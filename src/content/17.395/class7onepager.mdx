## bonvillian and weiss, _taking covered wagons east_ (2009)

- The four step process for accelerating innovation in energy
    1. classify technologies
    2. classify support policies in tech-neutral packages, fit technologies
    3. perform institutional gap analysis
    4. provide remedies for gaps

### questions
- How does partisanship in America limit innovation? Or is innovation bipartisan? Are there ways to sidestep roadblocks introduced by partisanship?

## bonvillian and van atta, _applying the DARPA model to energy innovation_ (2011)

- High-level interventions from DARPA leadership and above keep DARPA from becoming entrenched in its current thrusts.
- ARPA-E has a two stage selection process, with feedback on proposals.
- Increased public-private partnerships (official or unofficial) will be needed to implement technology advances.

## bonvillian, _applying innovation policy to the U.S. energy/climate challenge_ (2016)

- Neoclassical economics has been able to make environmental progress by deploying readily available technology, but innovation policy will be needed to combat climate change, with its need for dramatic technological advances.
- Energy technology _implementation_ (rather than development) is the most daunting task.
- Scale-up financing for production of new energy technologies is still missing.

### questions
- What is the result of the SunShot Initiative? Is solar energy cost-competitive with fossil fuels?

## hart, bonvillian, austin, _energy storage for the grid: policy options for sustaining innovation_ (2018)

- Grid-scale energy storage will make decarbonizing electricity generation much easier, quicker, and cheaper than it would be otherwise.
- Technology lock-in typically occurs after the dominant design emerges. For grid-scale energy storage, Li-ion batteries appear to be the dominant design.
- Policymakers should promote a variety of solutions to the grid-scale energy storage problem, rather than focus on Li-ion batteries, which are already driving out alternative innovations.

### questions
- Should we neglect security for the sake of innovation speed? This is a common theme in breakthrough technologies: Internet, power grid, autonomous vehicles, etc.

## bonvillian, _addressing the scaleup challenge for hard technology startups_ (2017)

- Innovation is limited not by ideas, but by financing from prototype to usable solution.
- 47% of growth startups are in software, health, IT, advertising, and business services; not the hard technology we need.
- Venture capital often doesn't finance domestic manufacturing capability.

### questions
- What would the equivalent of an FDA look like for energy?
- What is the potential payout for a successful energy startup?
