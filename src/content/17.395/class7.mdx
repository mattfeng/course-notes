# class 7: energy

## bonvillian and weiss, _taking covered wagons east_ (2009)
- the most difficult step in developing and deploying new technology in energy and other complex, established sectors will be _launching these technologies into extremely complex and competitive markets for technology_.
    - any program of government support for innovations in these technologies should be organized around the _most likely bottleneck to their introduction to the market_
- four step analysis
    1. classify technologies based on _launch path_ bottlenecks
        - experimental technology
        - disruptive technology
        - secondary technology, uncontested launch
        - secondary technology, contested launch
        - incremental innovations in conservation and end-use efficiency
        - improvements in manufacturing processes
    2. classify support policies for encouraging energy innovation in technology-neutral packages
        - **_front-end_ technology nurturing.** direct government support for research and development
        - **_back-end_ incentives.** incentives to encourage technology transition
        - **_back-end_ regulatory and related mandates.**
    3. institutional gap analysis
        - e.g. energy: we do not have the capacity to
            - translate research into innovation
            - finance the scale-up of promising technologies
            - form an overall collaborative strategy between the public and private sectors to roadmap the details involved in developing and deploying new technologies at scale
    4. recommend new institutions and organizational mechansisms to fill technology gaps

## bonvillian and van atta, _applying the DARPA model to energy innovation_ (2011)

- other important elements of the DARPA model
    - **multigenerational technology thrusts**
        - _how does DARPA keep technology thrusts from becoming entrenched resource allocations that weigh down the organization?_
            - e.g. early missile defense work, DEFENDER
            - ans: requires high-level intervention from the agency director and above DARPA
    - **complementary strategic tech**
        - DARPA uses **complementarity**; it approaches problems with a diverse set of potential solutions
    - **confluence with an advocate community**
        - community consists of
            - program managers
            - graduates of the DARPA program
            - contractors in universities and industry trained in the DARPA model
        - the community is a close-knit network of individuals who know and trust each other, break down information and collaboration barriers
        - DARPA players connect and see how they can do _future work_
    - **connected to larger innovation elements**
        - VC connection
    - **takes on incumbents**
    - **first adopter/initial market creation role**

## bonvillian, _applying innovation policy to the U.S. energy/climate challenge_ (2016)

- **exogeneous (neoclassical economics).** factors that cannot be measured.
    - e.g. complex social systems, innovation systems

## hart, bonvillian, austin, _energy storage for the grid: policy options for sustaining innovation_ (2018)

_state-led innovation initiatives, “dominant technology” challenges and “stranded innovation” energy technologies_

## bonvillian, _addressing the scaleup challenge for hard technology startups_ (2017)

_the challenge of scaleup for startups attempting complex technologies that must be manufactured including for energy_

## bonvillian and weiss, _taking covered wagons east_ (2009)

- The four step process for accelerating innovation in energy
    1. classify technologies
    2. classify support policies in tech-neutral packages, fit technologies
    3. perform institutional gap analysis
    4. provide remedies for gaps

### questions
- How does partisanship in America limit innovation? Or is innovation bipartisan? Are there ways to sidestep roadblocks introduced by partisanship?

## bonvillian and van atta, _applying the DARPA model to energy innovation_ (2011)

- High-level interventions from DARPA leadership and above keep DARPA from becoming entrenched in its current thrusts.
- ARPA-E has a two stage selection process, with feedback on proposals.
- Increased public-private partnerships (official or unofficial) will be needed to implement technology advances.

## bonvillian, _applying innovation policy to the U.S. energy/climate challenge_ (2016)

- Neoclassical economics has been able to make environmental progress by deploying readily available technology, but innovation policy will be needed to combat climate change, with its need for dramatic technological advances.
- Energy technology _implementation_ (rather than development) is the most daunting task.
- Scale-up financing for production of new energy technologies is still missing.

### questions
- What is the result of the SunShot Initiative? Is solar energy cost-competitive with fossil fuels?

## hart, bonvillian, austin, _energy storage for the grid: policy options for sustaining innovation_ (2018)

- Grid-scale energy storage will make decarbonizing electricity generation much easier, quicker, and cheaper than it would be otherwise.
- Technology lock-in typically occurs after the dominant design emerges. For grid-scale energy storage, Li-ion batteries appear to be the dominant design.
- Policymakers should promote a variety of solutions to the grid-scale energy storage problem, rather than focus on Li-ion batteries, which are already driving out alternative innovations.

### questions
- Should we neglect security for the sake of innovation speed? This is a common theme in breakthrough technologies: Internet, power grid, autonomous vehicles, etc.

## bonvillian, _addressing the scaleup challenge for hard technology startups_ (2017)

- Innovation is limited not by ideas, but by financing from prototype to usable solution.
- 47% of growth startups are in software, health, IT, advertising, and business services; not the hard technology we need.
- Venture capital often doesn't finance domestic manufacturing capability.

### questions
- What would the equivalent of an FDA look like for energy?
- What is the potential payout for a successful energy startup?
