# class 7: energy

## bonvillian and weiss, _taking covered wagons east_ (2009)
- the most difficult step in developing and deploying new technology in energy and other complex, established sectors will be _launching these technologies into extremely complex and competitive markets for technology_.
    - any program of government support for innovations in these technologies should be organized around the _most likely bottleneck to their introduction to the market_
- four step analysis
    1. classify technologies based on _launch path_ bottlenecks
        - experimental technology
        - disruptive technology
        - secondary technology, uncontested launch
        - secondary technology, contested launch
        - incremental innovations in conservation and end-use efficiency
        - improvements in manufacturing processes
    2. classify support policies for encouraging energy innovation in technology-neutral packages
        - **_front-end_ technology nurturing.** direct government support for research and development
        - **_back-end_ incentives.** incentives to encourage technology transition
        - **_back-end_ regulatory and related mandates.**
    3. institutional gap analysis
        - e.g. energy: we do not have the capacity to
            - translate research into innovation
            - finance the scale-up of promising technologies
            - form an overall collaborative strategy between the public and private sectors to roadmap the details involved in developing and deploying new technologies at scale
    4. recommend new institutions and organizational mechansisms to fill technology gaps

## bonvillian and van atta, _applying the DARPA model to energy innovation_ (2011)

- other important elements of the DARPA model
    - **multigenerational technology thrusts**
        - _how does DARPA keep technology thrusts from becoming entrenched resource allocations that weigh down the organization?_
            - e.g. early missile defense work, DEFENDER
            - ans: requires high-level intervention from the agency director and above DARPA
    - **complementary strategic tech**
        - DARPA uses **complementarity**; it approaches problems with a diverse set of potential solutions
    - **confluence with an advocate community**
        - community consists of
            - program managers
            - graduates of the DARPA program
            - contractors in universities and industry trained in the DARPA model
        - the community is a close-knit network of individuals who know and trust each other, break down information and collaboration barriers
        - DARPA players connect and see how they can do _future work_
    - **connected to larger innovation elements**
        - VC connection
    - **takes on incumbents**
    - **first adopter/initial market creation role**

## bonvillian, _applying innovation policy to the U.S. energy/climate challenge_ (2016)

- **exogeneous (neoclassical economics).** factors that cannot be measured.
    - e.g. complex social systems, innovation systems

## hart, bonvillian, austin, _energy storage for the grid: policy options for sustaining innovation_ (2018)

_state-led innovation initiatives, “dominant technology” challenges and “stranded innovation” energy technologies_

## bonvillian, _addressing the scaleup challenge for hard technology startups_ (2017)

_the challenge of scaleup for startups attempting complex technologies that must be manufactured including for energy_

## class 7 lecture notes

- new innovations need to be price competitive as soon as they enter the market (innovating in established sectors)
- a carbon tax is hard to implement because consumers expect low prices
- a public strategy for energy technology should be
    1. very large in scale and scope
        - but not in form or organization
    2. private sector led
        - via public/private partnerships
    3. technology neutral 
        - to avoid technology lock-in (e.g. corn-based fuels)
    4. organized around obstacles to market launch
