# class 9 one pager: the life science r&d model (NIH)

## National Institute of Medicine (NAS), _Enhancing the Vitality of the National Institutes of Health_ (2003)

- An Office of the NIH Director Special Projects could fund high-risk research, essentially a DARPA for NIH.
- NIH consists of 27 ICs (institutes and centers), even in 2021.
- NIH has two kinds of centers: research centers and operational support centers (e.g. Center for Scientific Review).
- The NIH is run by the Office of the NIH Director (OD).
- Program offices in the OD support initiatives that don't cleanly fall in the domain of any IC.
- 80% of funds disbured by NIH are done via peer review.

### questions
- This paper was written in 2003. Is it time to review NIH's organization again? How often should an evaluation of restructuring be done?
- Does NIH have a clinical research IC now? Why were many of the suggestions in this paper rejected or not implemented?

## Robert Cook-Deegan, _Does NIH Need a DARPA?_ (1996)

- The biggest reason for a DARPA model in NIH is to fight peer review's tendency towards conservative science.
- The DARPA model is not suitable for the majority of science (i.e. don't take things to the extreme); it's best suited for progress in key areas where technology is promising but not yet proven.

### questions
- What is the political process for starting an ARPA organization?
- If the government does not implement an ARPA Health, is it possible for a private model of ARPA to emerge?

## William B. Bonvillian and Charles Weiss, _Chapter 7: Health Delivery_ (2015)

- The lack of transparency and competition in the payment model of Medicare and Medicaid contributes to the U.S.'s dramatic healthcare costs.
- NIH is strongly focused on the biological aspects of healthcare (e.g. drugs, surgery), but lacks support for medical devices and IT.
- Clinical trial structure leads to a "blockbuster drug" model, which limits the kinds of drugs that are pursued by pharmaceutical companies.
- Lack of standards in health IT limit adoption. The cost of health IT implementation is also ineffectively placed on healthcare systems, which leads to limited adoption.

### questions
- How do we address _lumpiness_ of new drugs with policy (i.e. the blockbuster drug model)? Are there ways to accelerate drug approvals when the patient population is small and specific?
