# class 9 one pager: the life science r&d model (NIH)

## National Institute of Medicine (NAS), _Enhancing the Vitality of the National Institutes of Health_ (2003) (pp. 1-101)

- An Office of the NIH Director Special Projects could fund high-risk research, essentially a DARPA for NIH.
- NIH consists of 27 ICs (institutes and centers), even in 2021.
- NIH has two kinds of centers: research centers and operational support centers (e.g. Center for Scientific Review).
- The NIH is run by the Office of the NIH Director (OD).
- Program offices in the OD support initiatives that don't cleanly fall in the domain of any IC.
- 80% of funds disbured by NIH are done via peer review.

### questions
- This paper was written in 2003. Is it time to review NIH's organization again? How often should an evaluation of restructuring be done?
- Does NIH have a clinical research IC now? Why were many of the suggestions in this paper rejected or not implemented?

## Robert Cook-Deegan, _Does NIH Need a DARPA?_ (1996)

- The biggest reason for a DARPA model in NIH is to fight peer review's tendency towards conservative science.
- The DARPA model is not suitable for the majority of science (i.e. don't take things to the extreme); it's best suited for progress in key areas where technology is promising but not yet proven.

### questions
- What is the political process for starting an ARPA organization?
- If the government does not implement an ARPA Health, is it possible for a private model of ARPA to emerge?

## William B. Bonvillian and Charles Weiss, _Chapter 7: Health Delivery_ (2015)

- The lack of transparency and competition in the payment model of Medicare and Medicaid contributes to the U.S.'s dramatic healthcare costs.
- NIH is strongly focused on the biological aspects of healthcare (e.g. drugs, surgery), but lacks support for medical devices and IT.
- Clinical trial structure leads to a "blockbuster drug" model, which limits the kinds of drugs that are pursued by pharmaceutical companies.
- Lack of standards in health IT limit adoption. The cost of health IT implementation is also ineffectively placed on healthcare systems, which leads to limited adoption.
- The current mixture of private and public payers in healthcare delivery promotes
    - medical procedures over nonmedical interventions to improve public health,
    - expansion of services without prioritizing performance.
- Much medical technology has not been objectively tested for effectiveness.

### questions
- How do we address _lumpiness_ of new drugs with policy (i.e. the blockbuster drug model)? Are there ways to accelerate drug approvals when the patient population is small and specific?

## MIT, _Convergence: The Future of Health_ (2016)

- _Convergence Research (CR)_ is the blending of math, computation, engineering, and sciences for technological breakthroughs.
- CR is inhibited by siloed grant applications and funding, lack of high-quality STEM education, and lack of interdisciplinary education.
- Industry must tackle the blockbuster drug model that hinders development of personalized medicine (including rare-disease drugs).
- Graduate students are trained too narrowly for academia.

### questions
- How do you convince politicians to increase funding for research? Where does the money come from (or, perhaps more correctly, where is capital in the U.S. being wastefully horded)?

## David Adler, _Operation Warp Speed: A New Model for Industrial Policy_ (2021)

- Reindustrialization requires sustained demand.
- America suffers from the scale-up problem; breakthroughs are found in America, but are manufactured abroad.
- Market incumbents use free-market platitudes to protect their profits.
- The dynamic nature of comparative advantage in free trade is not acknowledged enough by economists.
- OWS worked because it
    - took away R&D and regulatory risk
    - provided financing
    - assisted in tech transfer for manufacturing
    - supported a robust domestic supply chain (supply chain mapping)
    - guaranteed demand (contracts)
- The US lacks institutions to commercialize and scale new technology.

### questions
- What is the nature of America's wealth inequality?
- While innovation produces a growth in capital, a _necessary_ condition for increasing the standard of living, the growing wealth inequality indicates that innovation policy is not _sufficient_ for creating a prosperous society. What other policies are needed to build prosperity, beyond primarily redistributive policies (e.g. wealth tax, universal basic income)?
- What are the areas that US should prioritize creating &ldquo;Warp Speeds&rdquo; for?
    - computer chips
    - high speed rail
