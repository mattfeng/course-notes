## Jonas Nahm and Edward Steinfeld, _Scale-Up Nation: Chinese Specialization in Innovative Manufacturing_ (2012)

_China’s “scale-up” manufacturing capability_

- Four patterns of scale up
    - backward design and reverse engineering; selecting only the core features to make scale up easier
    - making someone else's new product design come true
        - often, the original designer doesn't know how to design for manufacturing
    - rapidly scaled new-to-the-world product innovation
        - Chinese firms can recognize markets and create their own designs using their knowledge of scale-up manufacturing
    - product platform for technology co-development and absorption
