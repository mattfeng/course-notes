# class 8: advanced manufacturing


## Paul A. Samuelson, _Where Ricardo and Mill Rebut and Confirm Arguments of Mainstream Economists Supporting Globalization_ (2004)

_economic fundamentals and offshore outsourcing – do not need to follow the econometrics_

## Suzanne Berger, _How We Compete_ (2005)

_the distributed production model for manufacturing firms_

- **societal capital.** the stock of infrastructure in a society: its financial institutions, legal system, business practices, bureaucracy, research institutions, and public culture.
- Chinese companies
    - Lenovo
    - Bird
    - TCL
- China has industry/academia/government hubs like the US as well
    - Tsinghua works with companies and government

## Gary Pisano and Willy Shih, _Restoring American Competitiveness_ (2009)

_challenges to US advanced manufacturing_

- **industrial commons.** the collective R&D, engineering, and manufacturing capabilities that sustain innovation
- **&ldquo;the world is flat&rdquo;.**an ideal proposed by Thomas Friedman that distance and location no longer matter


## Jonas Nahm and Edward Steinfeld, _Scale-Up Nation: Chinese Specialization in Innovative Manufacturing_ (2012)

_China’s “scale-up” manufacturing capability_

- Four patterns of scale up
    - backward design and reverse engineering; selecting only the core features to make scale up easier
    - making someone else's new product design come true
        - often, the original designer doesn't know how to design for manufacturing
    - rapidly scaled new-to-the-world product innovation
        - Chinese firms can recognize markets and create their own designs using their knowledge of scale-up manufacturing
    - product platform for technology co-development and absorption


## William B. Bonvillian, _Advanced Manufacturing: A New Policy Challenge_ (2017)
    
_the decline of U.S. manufacturing from 2000-2010, emerging policies, and the advanced manufacturing institute model_

- why did manufacturing lose 1/3 of its workforce in a decade?
- the currency of world trade is high-value goods (not services).

## William B. Bonvillian and Peter Singer, _Advanced Manufacturing – The New American Innovation Policies_ (2018)

_technological job displacement, productivity, and “secular stagnation”_

- addressing headwinds presents the best opportunity for improving growth
    - educational attainment
    - income inequality
    - changing demographics
    - government debt
    - social breakdown in the U.S.

## Jonas Nahm and Edward Steinfeld, _Scale-Up Nation: Chinese Specialization in Innovative Manufacturing_ (2012)
- China has lots of rapid prototyping companies

## William B. Bonvillian, _Advanced Manufacturing: A New Policy Challenge_ (2017)
- manufacturing firms ecosystem has thinned out
- small, mid-sized, and start-up firms can' get financing to scale up production
- social disruption due to decreasing manufacturing
- without manufacturing, **it is difficult to scale up productivity gains** (the services sector cannot scale up so quickly, e.g. 1 item to 14 million in four months)
- we lost manufacturing jobs because productivity was down; we lost the jobs to _international competition_ (other countries became more productive in manufacturing)
- manufacturing-led innovation systems
    - Germany, Korea, China
- new advanced manufacturing paradigms
    - network centric/digital production
    - advanced materials
    - nanomanufacturing
    - mass customization
    - distribution efficiency
    - photonics, advanced composites, biofabrication
