# class 5: orgn of inno sysms at the f2f level

## rosen, _the most powerful idea in the world_ (2010)
- _the role of the tactile, vision, and social networks in innovation_
-  experiments calibrated to measure heightened activity in portions of brain when eukera moments strike <T tag="Mark Jung-Beeman and John Kounios" />
    - blood flow to anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) during eureka moments
    - most normal brain activity serves to _inhibit_ blood flow to the aSTG
        - eukera moments come during relaxing moments; daydreaming
- poll of more than 700 patentees; study conducted by <T tag="Joseph Rossman" /> in 1930s
    - greatest barrier to invention: **lack of capital**
- experimental rigor, with knowledge of mathematics, speeds up the rate of invention.
- **John Smeaton** (<T tag="lookup" color="#5ed4e3" />) studied waterwheels
    - had a systematic technique of varying parameters
    - had a strong **social** effect (teaching other engineers how to be systematic)
- **Flynn effect**. the current generation scores higher on general intelligence tests than previous generations
    - by a lot: bottom 10% matches previous generation's top 10% 
- economist **Fritz Machlup** <T tag="lookup" color="#5ed4e3" />
    - is it possible to expand the inventive workforce?
    - can labor be diverted into the business of invention?
    - can an educational or training system emphasize invention?
- statue of James Watt is symbolic in the mindset shift: shift from worship or adoration of kinds to adoration of makers and inventors.

## bennis and beiderman, _organizing genius_ (1997)
- life in **great groups** is better than normal life
    - disney animators (_bambi_)

### 15 take-home lessons
1. greatness starts with superb people.
2. great groups and great leaders create each other.
3. every great group has a strong leader.
    - acts a steward: 
        - keep everyone focused
        - eliminating distractions
        - keep hope alive in the face of setbacks and stress
    - defining feature of leaders: _ability to recognize excellence in others and their work_
    - the leader **must be worthy of the group**; respect from those of greater genius is a must

    - many great groups start with great Rolodexes
    - **the broader and more diverse the network, the greater the potential for a great group**.
5. great groups are full of talented people who can work together.
    - personalities are not always affable, but they are honest and advance the common cause.
6. great groups think they are on a mission from god.
    - another great group leader: **James Carville** <T tag="lookup" color="#5ed4e3" /> of the Clinton War Room.
    - leaders of great groups understand the power of rhetoric
    - they recruit people for crusades, not jobs
7. every great group is an island &ndash; but an island with a bridge to the mainland.
8. great groups see themselves as winning underdogs.
9. great groups always have an enemy.
    - you can't have a war without one
10. people in great groups have blinders on.
    - the project is all they see
    - often members are making a Faustian bargain
11. great groups are optimistic, not realistic.
    - members believe they can do things no one has ever done before
    - members are simultaneously _analytical_ and _confident_
12. in great groups, the right person has the right job.
13. the leaders of great groups give them what they need and free them from the rest.
    - great groups reflect the leader's profound, not necessarily conscious, understanding of what brilliant people want
    - talented people don't need fancy facilities, but _they need the right tools_
    - all great groups _share information effectively_
    - genuine camaraderie, based on shooting the moon together, is the ideal climate of a great group

## schein, _DEC is dead, long live DEC_ (pp. 123-169) (2004)
- as an organization becomes larger, a need for a centralizing vision becomes more important
- everyone at DEC (including sales, service, HR, technology) felt empowered to try new things if they made sense
    - &ldquo;think for yourself and do the right thing&rdquo;
- DEC's heyday brust in the 1988-1992 period
    - two years of losses
    - product failures
    - growing organizational turmoil
    - Ken Olsen's resignation
- things to understand
    1. how technological and market changes required new organizational and managerial responses
    2. how organizational success produced growth, and how _both growth and aging_ created some visible and invisible consequences that required new managerial responses
    3. how the culture that resulted from earlier successes became more and more stable
    4. how elements of that culture became dysfunctional as the organziation's technological and economic environment changed

### chapter 9. the impact of changing technology
- the computer revolution developed in three **paradigms** of computing
    1. **batch computing**
        - user was forced to adapt to the computer
        - submit punch cards to run together
        - large (mainframes)
        - expensive
        - leased
    2. **time-shared computing**
        - users had direct connections to the shared computer via terminals
        - used minicomputers
            - medium sized computers that were purchased and managed at the divisional or departmental level
    3. **client-server computing**
        - inexpensive client computers (PCs, workstations)
        - dedicated servers where applications resided
- these three paradigms shifted
    - _who used computers_
    - _how they were purchased_, _financed_, _managed_, and _serviced_.
- because DEC has a new computing paradigm, they had to expand to cover all the accessories associated with their paradigm
    - e.g. peripherals, storage tape, networking, software

#### anatomy of a technology wave
- two distinct stages: **creation stage** and **commodification stage**, separated by the **dominant design**
