# class 8: advanced manufacturing

## Paul A. Samuelson, _Where Ricardo and Mill Rebut and Confirm Arguments of Mainstream Economists Supporting Globalization_ (2004)

_economic fundamentals and offshore outsourcing – do not need to follow the econometrics_

- An innovation in another country can decrease a country's well-being by worsening its trade position (comparative advantage).

### questions
- Are certain top economists simply mistaken, or are there reasons that they continue to argue that global trade is indisputably good?

## Suzanne Berger, _How We Compete_ (2005)

_the distributed production model for manufacturing firms_

- Slow-tech, labor intensive industries will continue to lose jobs as technology improves. However, it is not a sunset sector. The sector simply has a larger range of higher value products to create.
- In other words, foreign competitors whose competitive advantage is cheap labor attack from the bottom (the lowest-end products).
- It is very difficult to leverage cheap labor as a competitive advantage, contrary to classical macroeconomic theory.
- Having entry-level positions (rather than out-sourcing) is vital for a company to continue having skilled employees in the future.
- The most resilient competitive advantage is the ability to detect opportunities and _develop capabilities_ to exploit them.

### questions
- This book was written in 2005. How have its comments on China shifted in validity?

## Gary Pisano and Willy Shih, _Restoring American Competitiveness_ (2009)

_challenges to US advanced manufacturing_

- Distance matters when discussing skill and tacit knowledge as a result of the need for face-to-face communication and local job-hopping.
- The _industrial commons_ is vital because it provides a source of knowledge and practical know-how that companies can use, and that entire new industries can spawn from (e.g. solar panels).
- Contractors become ODMs (original design manufacturers) that compete with the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) that originally contracted them.
- Government has been effective in supporting innovation by acting as a customer.
- Financial tools are limited in their ability to value projects.

### questions
- How do you build an industrial commons (is there a playbook)?
- What incentives need to change to avoid chasing short-term gains?

## Jonas Nahm and Edward Steinfeld, _Scale-Up Nation: Chinese Specialization in Innovative Manufacturing_ (2012)

_China’s “scale-up” manufacturing capability_

- Chinese manufacturers have developed unparalleled skills in the management of three variables: tempo, production volume, and cost. Scaling up production is the fastest in China.
- Accumulation of firm-specific know-how via extensive, multidirectional interfirm learniing is key to China's specialization at scale-up.
- State ownership doesn't explain China's manufacturing ability is many sectors, such as photovoltaics.
- Exogenous factors cannot ensure a firm will gain the know-how to move down the experience curve.
- Improvisation of policy is the norm, and so producers have become highly flexible.

### questions
- Will China's current capitals investments introduce lock-in? Or are they structured in a way that change is always incorporated?
- What is the environmental impact of China's scale-up capabilities?

## William B. Bonvillian, _Advanced Manufacturing: A New Policy Challenge_ (2017)
    
_the decline of U.S. manufacturing from 2000-2010, emerging policies, and the advanced manufacturing institute model_

- A high-cost, high-wage prodution sector doesn't inevitably lose out to a low-cost one (e.g. Germany's manufacturing sector).
- Manufacturing contributes approximately 12% of the U.S. GDP. Manufacturing is also vital as it is central to the implementation stage of innovation.

### questions
- How do agreements like the WTO limit our ability to tackle complex challenges such as climate change?

## William B. Bonvillian and Peter Singer, _Advanced Manufacturing – The New American Innovation Policies_ (2018)

_technological job displacement, productivity, and “secular stagnation”_

- Increasing automation and education leads to labor market polarization. It is not guarantee that humans and machines will work symbiotically such that an equivalent number of jobs are created.
- Low productivity growth limits the amount of income available to address social well-being.
- Secular stagnation is defined by weak recoveries and immovable depressions.

### questions
- Why is there a growing number of lower end, lower pay service jobs?
- Will increasing education guarantee that people can keep up with skill and education curves?
- Will the Biden infrastructure bill work as an infrastructure stimulus (as outlined in the paper)?
