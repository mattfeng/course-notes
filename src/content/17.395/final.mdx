## Future Trends in Synthetic Biology — A Report

## ideas

### process engineering is needed in US
- Amyris runs SB manufacturing in China[^A]

### education in synthetic biology
- need education in skills but also ethics[^F]
- **support educational initiatives such as BioBuilder**[^J]

### what SB still lacks
- need instruments able to measure and characterize outputs[^F]
    - assisted by progress in robotics and automation
    - applying machine learning to analyze data generated
- challenges[^F]
    - design with scalability in mind
    - expanding the hosts used
    - standards for
        - design
        - assembly
        - data transfer
        - data measurement
        - regulatory rules
        - language used

### case study: artemisinin production by sanofi
- stopped production because costs were higher than the agricultural production
- competitors in China and India were unwilling to source artemisinin from competitor

### recommendations
- Larger and longer investment in better big data management and processing (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) systems, and in fundamental research on biosystems modeling, chassis development, and genome mining.[^F]
- Support standardization initiatives; while arguably not attractive academically, the community needs to agree and support efforts toward creating interoperability around biosystem modeling, and standards around DNA design (if not DNA bioparts). Without some degree of “standardization” the ability to pool data and models, essential for improving accuracy and reproducibility, will be challenging.[^F]
- The creation and funding (ideally internationally) of a “Grand Challenge,” such as the development of generic sensors or the creation of protein-based electronic components, could help focus the community toward a target goal.[^F]
- Improve the assessment, communication, and management of risk and harm among all audiences.[^F]
- Ensure that early career researchers are trained in responsible research conduct and ethics as well as being cognizant of existing rules and regulations around GM (regionally dependent) and the issue of misuse and harm.[^F]
- Coordinate the efforts of academia, government and industry through focused meetings that foster interdisciplinary collaborations around shared objectives.[^F]
- Improve platforms for knowledge sharing and recognize the value of failures.[^F]


### current SB landscape
- HGP-write project[^H]
- $4.6B invested in SB companies in Q1 2020[^B]
- Current landscape of SB companies[^B]
    - public
        - Codexis
        - Ginkgo Bioworks
        - Twist Bioscience
        - Precigen
        - Amyris
            - **marketed Artemisinin**
            - Sanofi was supposed to produce it, but stopped because it was too expensive (more expensive than sourcing from the plant)[^D]
    - private
        - Apeel Sciences
        - Insitro
        - ElevateBio
            - ElevateBio BaseCamp – the heart of our operations – is a dedicated cell and gene therapy research, process development, and production center that addresses the primary obstacles in cell and gene therapy and regenerative medicine: integrated research, process development and manufacturing.

## chapter 9: TILS, _enabling and disabling national innovation environments in Europe, China, and India_

- national innovation system (NIS)
    - the players in innovation: firms, government, universities, labs
    - policies, programs, and institutions intended to help overcom eknown deficiencies in the NIC
- national innovation context (NIC)
    - key elements
        - culture (attitude toward competition, cooperation, risk, novelty, entrepreneurship, social class)
        - religion
        - social structure (social mobility, relations between researchers and businesspeople)
        - economic perspectives of political system
        - macroeconomic policy
        - banking and finance system
        - industrial structure
        - business climate
        - trade and exchange rate policy
        - labor and environmental policies
        - immigration laws
        - bankruptcy and real estate law
        - legal system
        - state of physical infrastructure and connectivity
        - definition of innovation (radical or incremental)
- NIS have inertia; they like to do what they are good at, not necessarily the newest thing
- NIC has strong effect in the _direction of innovation_
    - e.g. which technologies are developed? depends on environmental and worker policies
