# final paper: synthetic biology

## general notes
- **synthetic biology.** the engineering of biology: the synthesis of complex, biological-inspired systems, which display functions that do not exist in nature
- upcoming technology within synbio
    - cell-free systems (3)
- [biobricks standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioBrick) and the [synthetic biology open language (SBOL)](https://sbolstandard.org/)
- applications of synbio
    - biosensors
    - cellular agriculture
    - new materials
    - cell transformation
    - protein design
    - space exploration
    - drug delivery

- synthetic biology driving science
- fundamental insight into biological processes, like the
    - role and sources of biological noise
    - existence of biological modules with defined properties
    - dynamics of oscillatory behavior
    - gene transcription and translation
    - cell communication
- successful applications of synbio
- in 2007, Europe lagging behind US in synthetic biology
