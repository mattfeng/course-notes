# class 6: DARPA

## bonvillian, _innovating in the defense sector_

- channel DARPA innovation into three areas
    - stealth
    - precision strike
    - unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
- **RMA.** &ldquo;Revolution in Military Affairs&rdquo;

### the DOD's systems approach
- DOD manages **paradigm-consistent** advances
- institutions and functions
    1. _breakthrough R&D._ DARPA
    2. _prototype/demonstration/test bed._ FFRDCs and service laboratories
    3. _engineering and incremental advances._ development and procurement programs
    4. _initial market creation._ services-based procurement program

### defense as a legacy sector
1. _politically powerful vested interests_. existing missions and capital platform commitments
2. _cost structures_. long-term contracts
3. _institutional architecture._ the winner of the contract takes on leadership roles in the DOD, which limits who will win the next contract
4. _established knowledge and human resources structures._
- other issues
    - _split incentives_. different services don't want to invest in technologies that would _also_ benefit other services, since that is a use of funds that isn't 100% for themselves
    - _collective action._ each service budget is separate; cross-service procurement doesn't exist
- challenges
    1. problems in linking innovators (DARPA) with service-led implementation
    2. lack of clarity among services on national security threats
    3. defense business practices that limit innovation, resilience, and adaptability (e.g. Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable; i.e. bare minimum)
    4. too long of an innovation timeline

### stealth aircraft
- eventually became the F-117 strike fighter
- DARPA only succeeded because of its connections and support from the highest levels of DOD leadership (Secretary and DDR&Es)

### precision strike
- leadership from Office of the Secretary of Defense was required to build and mount precision strike

### unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)
- congress forced the consolidation of service UAV programs into a joint program office, which led to the third generation of UAV technology
- deployed UAVs
    - Predator
    - Global Hawk
        - used DARPA's **Other Transaction Authority**

### role of DARPA
- for IT, DARPA purposely used the civilian sector for commercialization
    - military has difficulty finding money for ongoing development, incremental advances, and driving down the cost curve
- both a _graet group_ and an _innovation ecosystem_ are needed for innovation; DARPA operates both
- DARPA ruleset
    1. _small and flexible._ consists only of 100-150 professionals
    2. _flat._
    3. _right-left challenge model._
    4. _entrepreneurial._ selects high-talent, entrepreneurial program managers with academic and industry experience, who servce for 3-5 year durations
    5. _no laboratories._ no internal laboratory
    6. _acceptance of risk._ selects projects based on high-risk, high-reward
    7. _seed and scale._
    8. _autonomy and freedom from bureaucratic impediments._
    9. _hybrid model._
    10. _teams and networks._
    11. _acceptance of failure._
    12. _orientation to revolutionary breakthroughs in a connected approach._
    13. _a technology visioning process._

### why innovation works in the DOD
1. DARPA provides the innovations
2. _Secretary of Defense_ can mandate implementation

- three factors needed
    1. strong research capability
    2. change agents who can bring the innovation to reality
    3. meta-change agents who give the change agents authority to do so

## fong, _ARPA does windows: the defense underpinning of the PC revolution_

- government's role in Silicon Valley's success should not be overlooked
- Xerox PARC is associated with significant government-sponsored work in desktop computing
- government played a role in pre-commercialization stages
- what was PARC doing when much of its talent was moving to other companies (e.g. apple and microsoft)?
- Xerox was the leader in HCI: desktop metaphor, mouse, overlapping windows, full graphical display, etc.

### the rest of the story, i.e. the government's role
- innovations and people at PARC were influenced by government-sponsored intiatives started by
    - Vannevar Bush
    - J.C.R. Licklider
    - Ivan Sutherland
- Vannevar Bush
    - first theorized the GUI as the _memex_ and its applications
- J.C.R. Licklider
    - MIT professor, moved to ARPA
    - ARPA IPTO (Information Processing Techniques Office) grants helped start computer science programs at MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Utah, and CMU
    - Licklider championed Bush's memex
    - Licklider's two ideas
        - intergalactic network
        - man-computer symbiosis
- Ivan Sutherland
    - succeeded Licklider as IPTO director
    - thesis: Sketchpad
        - sponsored by Army, Navy, and Air Force
    - light pen led to today's mouse

### ARPA moves to PARC
- Robert Taylor, Sutherland's successor, directed movement to PARC
    - envisioned a computer for every person
- after ARPA, led the CSL (Computer Science Laboratory) at PARC
- David Evans at Utah served as pipeline of students to PARC
- SRI
    - Douglas Engelbart: conducted studies on HCI, ended up with the _mouse_

### Bonvillian and Weiss, Innovating in the Defense Sector (2015)
- Although the defense department has pioneered many innovations, the defense sector is still a legacy sector:
    - political powerful vested interests,
    - cost structures (contracts)
    - institutional architecture
    - established knowledge and human resources structures
    - market failures
        - split incentives
        - collective action
- Innovation works because DARPA provides the breakthroughs, and the leaders (Defense Secretary) (meta-change agents) push those breakthroughs along to and procurement.
- DARPA's structure also aims to foster great groups.

#### Questions
- Have the other ARPAs had the same effect on civilian technology? In particular, the other ARPAs are not defense oriented in the first place, so we should expect to see more civilian facing innovation?
- Would it be feasible to create a change agent like DARPA for other legacy sectors, such as infrastructure? What different pressures would such a change agent face?
    - Who would mandate implementation?

### Fong, ARPA does Windows (2001)
- Contrary to Silicon Valley's claims, much of the personal computing revolution was funded by government.
- Xerox PARC's innovations: graphical user interfaces, desktop analogy, mouse pointer, overlapping windows, popup menus, etc. all stemmed from government funded academic research.
- Funding is one thing; the providers of the funding also recognized talent.
- This is a repeating theme: government-funded researchers go on to push commercial products (e.g. Bell Labs).

#### Questions
- What harms does the story line that &ldquo;Silicon Valley succeeded on its own&rdquo; bring with it?
- Why are innovators like Bush, Lidlicker, and Sutherland ignored in popular culture compared to that of Gates and Jobs? What does this say about how we view research contributions?
- In the larger scheme of innovation, does it matter that Xerox PARC failed to commercialize its technology? In other words, will technology be picked up by another company?
