# class 6: DARPA

## bonvillian, _innovating in the defense sector_

- channel DARPA innovation into three areas
    - stealth
    - precision strike
    - unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
- **RMA.** &ldquo;Revolution in Military Affairs&rdquo;

### the DOD's systems approach
- DOD manages **paradigm-consistent** advances
- institutions and functions
    1. _breakthrough R&D._ DARPA
    2. _prototype/demonstration/test bed._ FFRDCs and service laboratories
    3. _engineering and incremental advances._ development and procurement programs
    4. _initial market creation._ services-based procurement program

### defense as a legacy sector
1. _politically powerful vested interests_. existing missions and capital platform commitments
2. _cost structures_. long-term contracts
3. _institutional architecture._ the winner of the contract takes on leadership roles in the DOD, which limits who will win the next contract
4. _established knowledge and human resources structures._
- other issues
    - _split incentives_. different services don't want to invest in technologies that would _also_ benefit other services, since that is a use of funds that isn't 100% for themselves
    - _collective action._ each service budget is separate; cross-service procurement doesn't exist
- challenges
    1. problems in linking innovators (DARPA) with service-led implementation
    2. lack of clarity among services on national security threats
    3. defense business practices that limit innovation, resilience, and adaptability (e.g. Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable; i.e. bare minimum)
    4. too long of an innovation timeline

### stealth aircraft
- eventually became the F-117 strike fighter
- DARPA only succeeded because of its connections and support from the highest levels of DOD leadership (Secretary and DDR&Es)

### precision strike
- leadership from Office of the Secretary of Defense was required to build and mount precision strike

### unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)
- congress forced the consolidation of service UAV programs into a joint program office, which led to the third generation of UAV technology
- deployed UAVs
    - Predator
    - Global Hawk
        - used DARPA's **Other Transaction Authority**

### role of DARPA
- for IT, DARPA purposely used the civilian sector for commercialization
    - military has difficulty finding money for ongoing development, incremental advances, and driving down the cost curve
- both a _graet group_ and an _innovation ecosystem_ are needed for innovation; DARPA operates both
- DARPA ruleset
    1. _small and flexible._ consists only of 100-150 professionals
    2. _flat._
    3. _right-left challenge model._
    4. _entrepreneurial._ selects high-talent, entrepreneurial program managers with academic and industry experience, who servce for 3-5 year durations
    5. _no laboratories._ no internal laboratory
    6. _acceptance of risk._ selects projects based on high-risk, high-reward
    7. _seed and scale._
    8. _autonomy and freedom from bureaucratic impediments._
    9. _hybrid model._
    10. _teams and networks._
    11. _acceptance of failure._
    12. _orientation to revolutionary breakthroughs in a connected approach._
    13. _a technology visioning process._

### why innovation works in the DOD
1. DARPA provides the innovations
2. _Secretary of Defense_ can mandate implementation

- three factors needed
    1. strong research capability
    2. change agents who can bring the innovation to reality
    3. meta-change agents who give the change agents authority to do so
