- key contributions
    - documents the increasing costs of healthcare
    - analyzes unmet needs and emerging Convergence solutions
    - describes four Convergence approaches and the resulting technologies
    - reviews challenges constraining full potential of CR
    - recommends GAI launch a detailed strategy-development process
    - sets a vision for the future
- unmet meeds

### key facts
- chronic conditions account for more than 85% of U.S. healthcare costs
    - diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer
- the rising healthcare costs are projected to be 19% of GDP (over 3 trillion per year)
- lack of dedicated CR funding makes it
    - hard to track award money for CR
    - hard to award money for CR
        - grant reviews are disjointed
- lack of interdisciplinary education hinders CR

    1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
    2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
    3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
    4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
    5. What are the risks?
    6. How much will it cost?
    7. How long will it take?
    8. What are the mid-term and final &ldquo;exams&rdquo; to check for success?
