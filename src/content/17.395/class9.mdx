- **convergence research (CR)**. research that integrates engineering, physical sciences, life sciences, computation, and math/statistics.
- CR is hampered by funding models that assume distinct categories of science
- key contributions
    - documents the increasing costs of healthcare
    - analyzes unmet needs and emerging Convergence solutions
    - describes four Convergence approaches and the resulting technologies
    - reviews challenges constraining full potential of CR
    - recommends GAI launch a detailed strategy-development process
    - sets a vision for the future
- unmet meeds
    1. _cancer_
        - **cancer diagnostics**
            - status quo: expensive and inaccurate
        - **targeted drug delivery**
        - **cancer immunotherapy**
            - works on a limited set of cases
            - _better labeling of cancer features_ to create personalized immune therapies
    2. _infection and immunity_
        - **synbio treatments**
        - **low-cost diagnostics**
    3. _brain disorders and injuries_
        - **better maps of neural circuits (ChemE)**
    4. _heart disease, diabetes, inherited genetic disease_
        - **better wearables**
        - **genetic profiling for diagnosis**
- 4 convergence approaches
    1. **imaging**
    2. **nanotechnology**
    3. **regenerative engineering and medicine**
    4. **big data and health IT**
        - lack of data on other factors impacting health
            - environment
            - eating habits
            - lifestyle choices
- GAI strategy-development process
    - increase funding for NIH, NSF, DARPA, DOE in CR
    - create **CR working group** across NIH and other agencies to form research strategy

    - accidents
    - stroke
    - Alzheimer's 
    - diabetes
    - influenze and pneumonia
    - kidney disorders
    - depression-driven suicide

### key facts
- chronic conditions account for more than 85% of U.S. healthcare costs
    - diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer
- the rising healthcare costs are projected to be 19% of GDP (over 3 trillion per year)
- lack of dedicated CR funding makes it
    - hard to track award money for CR
    - hard to award money for CR
        - grant reviews are disjointed
- lack of interdisciplinary education hinders CR
