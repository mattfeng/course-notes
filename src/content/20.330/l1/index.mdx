# Lecture 1. Introduction and Subject Information

## Motivations for the course
- prior classes focus on molecular properties, how molecules interact, and what happens when they do
    - [20.320](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-320-analysis-of-biomolecular-and-cellular-systems-fall-2012/)
- this course: how do molecules get around?
- organization
    1. diffusion
    2. electric fields
    3. fluid mechanics
    4. fields + diffusion + reaction + convection
        - electrokinetics and forces: **debye layer**
- problem solving course: make a formula sheet (and map when to use each)
- most disciplines don't teach **transport**
- [Making it stick: convection, reaction and diffusion in surface-based biosensors (Squires, Messinger, Manalis)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18392027/)
    - developing a physically intuitive and practical understanding of analyte transport

### Why diffusion and fluid mechanics (parts 1 and 3)?
- most transport problems involve either
    - binding/release at a surface
    - binding/release in 3D
        - drug transport in tissues
- case study: anti-HER2 antibodies, [High Affinity Restricts the Localization and Tumor Penetration of scFv Antibody Molecules](https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/61/12/4750)

### Why fields (parts 2 and 4)?
- understanding EM interaction with tissue and biological systems
- utilizing EM interaction for clinical and biomedical applications
    - magnetic resonance imaging
    - deep brain stimulation
- other applications
    - biophysical cell phenotyping

### Overall theme
- **multiphysics behaviors in circulatory systems**
    - e.g. diet <RA /> blood physical properties affected <RA /> drug transport affected
