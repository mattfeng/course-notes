# Inverse design for molecules

## Chemical space
- the set of all possible chemical compounds
- size: approximately

## Discrete optimization is hard
- no gradients to guide us

## Inverse design
- Is there a $f^{-1}$ that given a property finds a candidate?
- Is there a way to use gradient-based optimization in molecular design?

## Molecular generation
- model should be
  - **diverse** (avoid mode collapse)
    - this is important because we want to be able to generate any number of molecules, not just one drug

## Invariances
- Permutation invariance
  - need to figure out "un-pooling"
  - there is a canonical choice _or_ augmentation with all permutations
