# Biotech business

## [Anatomy of a biotech business development deal (a16z)](https://archive.is/CUd9v)
- working with a large biopharma company (LC) has its benefits
- every biotech BD deal has three acts
  1. pre-term sheet
  2. term sheet
  3. post-term sheet
- in each act
  - tasks to complete
  - terms to know
  - pitfalls to avoid
  - advice from experience

### Pre-term sheet

#### Draft your work plan (WP)
- participants include
  - scientific champions (SC)
  - BD leads
- SC take the lead on drafting the WP
- WP should include
  - brief summary of collaboration goal
  - who contributes which pieces of the therapeutic
    - e.g. target, drug molecule
  - who's responsible for which steps of drug discovery
  - who's responsible for which deliverables
  - anticipated timelines for executing deliverables or achieving predetermined milestones
  - specific research budgets and reimbursements from the LC

#### Discuss your must-haves and no-gos
- some questions
  - what does each party want or care about?
  - what are the ballpark ranges for expected economic deal terms?
  - any limitations or terms that your partner knows in advance wiill be a no-go?

#### Ask about governance
- understand how LC reviews and approves BD partnerships
- often: BD lead + scientific team present to **scientific review committee** and **finance review committee**
- often useful to make a pseudo-term sheet without the legalese

### Term sheet (TS)
- hire an experienced lawyer
- be the first one to write the memo; gives you more negotiating room (anchoring of numbers)
- term sheet doesn't replace the full contract
- essential components of TS
  - who owns what intellectual property
  - license grant/option
  - exclusivity
    - **key point of leverage for startups**
  - preclinical and clinical development
    - preclinical R&D up to candidate nomination
    - IND package prep and filing
    - clinical development phases
    - manufacturing for clinical studies
  - commercialization
  - **governance**. who decides and who controls
  - economics
    - **upfront payments**
    - **equity**
      - reserve for later negotiations
    - **operating capital**
  - milestones
  - royalties

### Post-term sheet
- in negotiating, know
  - what you really care about
  - where you're willing to give in
