# Prostate cancer

- characteristic genomic feature
  - low occurence of mutations and focal copy number events
  - high occurence of broad copy number aberrations and gene fusions
  - common alterations
    - fusion of ETS with androgen-regulated genes
      - e.g. TMPRSS2 + ERG (ETS-related gene); found in 50% of prostate cancers
- ERG is a transcription factor; difficult to address because it is not druggable
- "double negative CRPC"
  - no neuroendocrine characteristics
  - independent of androgen signaling
- clonal evolution
  - NKX3-1 loss
  - FOXP1 loss
  - TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
- important feature of normal prostate epithelium: inefficient cellular metabolism that bypasses oxidative phosphorylation
