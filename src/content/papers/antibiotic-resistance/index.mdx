# Antibiotic resistance

## [The future of antibiotics begins with discovering new combinations](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.14649)
- multitargeting
  - e.g. fluoroquinolones
    - two topoisomerases
  - e.g. β-lactams
- β-lactamase inhibitors
- potential of **adjuvants** to rescue antibiotic activity
- because of the probabilistic nature of ADR (where higher numbers result in higher probabilities), **antibiotic treatments should focus on therapies that can rapidly reduce pathoogen popluation before drug resistance spawns.**
  - if drug is too effective, strong selective pressure can lead to drug-resistant bacteria to develop faster
- independent
  - e.g. **co-fluampicil** = ampicillin + flucloxacillin
- **antagonistic**
  - **hyperantagonistic**, aka **suppression**. combined effect is less than a single drug's effect
  - can reduce selective advantage of drug-resistant strains
    - second drug inhibits first; if bacteria becomes resistant to second drug, then first will kill $\to$ less resistance
- synergistic
  - **congruous**. both drugs have effect
    - e.g. metabolism-dependent + metabolism-independent pathways
  - **syncretic**. one drug, one adjuvant
    - e.g. β-lactamase inhibitor + β-lactam
  - **coalistic**. non-activity combined leads to emergent activity; known as **synthetic lethal**
- **collateral sensitivity**. resistance to one drug increases susceptibility to a second drug
- **higher order combinations (HOC)**. more than two drugs combined
- **hybrid antibiotics** can link together two **pharmacophores** while resulting in linked pharmacodynamics

### Combinatorial screening technologies
#### _In silico_ methods
- trained on **chemogenomic datasets**. fitness scores of sets of gene-deletion strains treated with small molecules
- `Overlap2 Method (O2M)`
- `INDIGO`. random forest, outperformed O2M
- `MAGENTA`. includes metabolism data

#### DiaMOND
- diagonal measurement of $n$-way drug interactions

#### Microfluidics
- kChip

### Models to predict drug interactions
- Bliss independence
- Loewe additivity

## A deep learning approach to antibiotic discovery
- clinical classes of antibiotics
  - beta-lactams
  - aminoglycosides
  - polymyxins
  - glycopeptides
  - pyrimidine
  - quinolone
  - oxazolidinone
  - sulfa
- high throughput screening has not discovered any new antibiotics
- method
  1. train DNN to predict growth inhibition of _E. coli_ using collection of 2335 molecules
  2. apply model to >107 million molecules to identify lead compounds
  3. select candidates based on prediction score threshold, chemical structure, and availability

### Results
- first developed _de novo_ training set from 1760 FDA approved drugs + 800 natural products: 2335 unique compounds
- OD600 < 0.2 $\implies$ growth inhibition
- **minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)**. lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that will inhibit the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation
- **colony forming unit (CFU)**. an estimate of the number of viable bacterial/fungal cells in a sample
