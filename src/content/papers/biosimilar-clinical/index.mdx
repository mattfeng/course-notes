# Clinical trials for biosimilars

## Clinical trial design in biosimilar drug development (2012)

### Abstract
- biologics are more prone to acute and chronic immune responses
- challenges
  - structural complexity
  - complex manufacturing process
  - immunogenic risk

### Introduction
- Production process
  - cloning of cDNA
  - expansion via fermentation
  - purification
  - validation
- Southern blots or mRNA sequence analysis to validation sequence of cloned gene

### The emergence of biosimilars
- Naming
  - Europe: Biosimilars
  - US: Follow on Biologics
  - Canada: Subsequent Entry Biologics (SEBs)
- first generation biologics
  - insulin
  - erythropoetin
  - granulocyte colony simulating factor
  - interferon-alfa
- second generation biologics
  - monoclonal antibodies
    - infliximab
    - trastuzumab
    - rituximab
