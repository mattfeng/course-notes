## feibleman: technology as skill
- **tool**, **skill**, **person**: who has the power?
    - operator often needs to fit the needs of the tool
- what skills are required to use a tool?
    - assumptions about skills needed to use a tool (_ableism_ and design injustice)
- "talent": natural skills
- _skills (using a tool) are disconnected from how the tool works_
    - is this good?
    - can we propagate injustice with this idea of abstraction?

## algorithmic justice league (algorithmic bias)
- completely "invisibilitize" entire chunks of the population
- _what happens when you open up the black box?_
- [**drag**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(clothing)) as _transformation_
    - designing by the affected communities to fight their oppression

## benjamin, introduction: discriminatory design, liberating imagination
- premise: narrative about **technology as betterment**
    - techno-optimism
- various forms of discrimination are embedded in technology
- need to be able to imagine other possibilities
- need to be guided by **radio imagination**
- **carceral continuum**:
    - obsession of technological fixes at every level

## predictive policing
- what are the incentives (of the designers, users)?
    - access to criminal data from companies vs. public citizens?

## writing exercise
### part 1
- Thinking about your proposed project, write out an argument that engages Costanza-Chock and/or Benjamin's arguments.
    - The design of new medicines has many questions of power within it: who decides what areas to focus on? For novel therapeutics, who gets access? An obsession over developing new drugs as "technocorrections" also often obscures the more core issues surrounding public health, such as nutrition.

### part 2
- Write a couple of sentences about an aspect of your project that uses at least one of the concepts in the concepts table.
    - Discriminatory design in the biotechnology funding process.
