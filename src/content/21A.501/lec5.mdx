## delamont and atkinson, _doctoring uncertainty_ (2001)
- phd students have to learn the craft of conducting experiments as they transition from controlled experiments to more open experiments, but the projects they work on are selected by their supervisor (PI) to be do-able.
- a key factor in driving success in phds is the community; both in support and sharing knowledge
- **tacit knowledge**. the ability the perform actions without necessarily being able to articulate how they are actually done; as compared to **algorithmic knowledge**
    - mode of teaching is **enculturation**: oral culture, trial-and-error, and practical example
    - mastery of indeterminate skills and knowledge is the real achievement
        - <T tag="comment" /> can see this through their ability to create
- the norm in publication is to _remove the tacit knowledge_ and not document the different trials in order to get experiments working
    - authors remove the messy technicalities of the research process
    - researchers judged papers by their knowledge of the competences of other groups, i.e. more tacit knowledge, knowledge that isn't in the paper

## farrar and trorey, _maxims, tacit knowledge, and learning: dry stone walling_ (2008)
- main ideas
    - learning is contextualized
    - learning did not take place in linear stages
    - maxims and rules of thumb were key elements in the learning process
- expertise
    - outstanding performance within a domain (skill)
    - deep understanding of a domain
        - quantity of knowledge <T tag="sternberg" />
        - better organized knowledge <T tag="sternberg" />

### the acquisition of expertise <T tag="dreyfus" />
- five stages
    1. novice
    2. advanced beginner
    3. competent
    4. proficient
    5. expert
- novice
    - looks for and is given _context-free features and rules_
- advanced beginner
    - learns _situational rules_ to augment the context-free rules
- competent
    - able to set goals and see what is needed to attain goals
    - able to see what needs to be attended to and what can be ignored
    - _reflection_ is important at this stage
- proficient
    - sees what needs to be achieved (subconscious), rather than deciding what needs to be achieved (conscious)
- expert
    - action is subconscious as well

### findings
- walkers talk best about what they are doing _when they are doing it_
- six themes
    1. learning by using rules
        - for more advanced drywallers, rules are only guidelines
    2. use of _maxims_ (situational rules)
        - only make sense to those in the trade
    3. tacit knowledge and intuition
    4. reflection, decision-making, and learning from mistakes
    5. _flow_ (total engagement with an activity)
        - all levels of expertise experience flow
        - even experts are not always in a state of flow
    6. emotional involvement
        - emotional commitment to learning is key to acquiring expertise

## d'ignacio and klein, _on rational, scientific, objective viewpoints from mythical, imaginary, impossible standpoints_ (2020)
- should a visualization be designed to evoke emotion?
    - _a unified theory of information design_ says no (visualization should be neutral, for reader to interpret the results)
- neutral visualizations are actually just _partial perspectives_, often those that reinforce the _status quo_ because the visualization doesn't encourage the viewer to consider alternative views
- **master stereotype.** women are more emotional than men
- _data feminism_: **embrace emotion and embodiment**
    - <T tag="comment" /> doesn't calling this practice "data feminism" reinforce the master stereotype?
- **framing effects.** certain things are highlighted while others are obscured <T tag="hullman and diakopoulos, 2011" />

### key argument
- it is impossible for data visualization to be wholy objective, as the data is embedded in a social context. data visualization should _embrace emotion and embodiment_ that attempts to give different and fuller viewpoints of the data.
- rhetoric is embedded in every design, even the supposedly &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; one
- every knowledge is
    - situated
    - partial
    - articulated from a particular positionality
- acknowledge that all science and work in the world is undertaken by individuals, each with a particular set of **positionalities** (where they stand and come from)

### ideas
- emotion (vs. cold, statistical, math)
- perspective (embracing other views of the data)
- argues against
    - strong objectivity
    - neutrality
- relations
- framing effects
- data visceralization

### what map doesn't use the god trick?
- maps are rhetorial because maps always attempt to fix a truth via
    - bounds
    - centers
- creating a better map
    - contexts
    - processes
    - _acknowledge the god trick_
    - a map created through the co-creation process

## collins, _what is tacit knowledge?_ (2001)
- _things that we can do but we don't know how to explain_
- knowledge that you might not even know that you know
- three levels of definitions
    - motor skills (motor)
    - rules regress (mental)
    - forms of life (context, traditions)
- **why does tacit knowledge resist explanation?**
    - limitations of processing capacity
    - tacit knowledge are too difficult to describe given our **limited processing capacity**
