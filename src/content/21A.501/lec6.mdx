    3. an ecology of relationships, inscriptions and co-opted artefacts is constitutive of learning and acting
    4. learning and communicating are social processes of co-participation as opposed to the acquisition and exchange of propositional or representational contents. 
- it is not a systematic corpus of knowledge that defines and maintains a community of practitioners, but rather certain social modes of co-participation in which transmission of knowledge and reproduction of the community is embedded.

    - describing the material as _overzealous_; **personification**, giving the material agency
    - **metaphor**
    - **analogies**
    - **imagery**; engagement of multiple senses
        - _detail_; investing the the quality of writing matters
    - _missing information_. the heat of the furnace
- novice $\overset{\text{acquisition of knowledge}}{\longrightarrow}$ proficient
    - drawing from what is already known (_habitus_)
    - ability to _anticipate_
- **temporality**; getting the time and rhythm right
- **feedback between the material and the body** for knowing what to do next (the body and the senses)
