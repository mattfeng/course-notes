# Lecture 1. Welcome to Medical Device Design

## Key questions for new technologies
- the **medical device tripod**
    - Clincal need
    - Technical feasibility
    - Business case
- Questions
    - What is the unmet clinical need?
    - Why is the current tech insufficient?
    - What is the clinical burden of proof?
    - What technologies already exist?
    - How much better do you need to be?
    - What is your biggest tech risk?
    - What is your regulatory path?
    - Who pays? Patient, doctor, hospital, insurer?
    - Will it make money? Save money? Cost more?
    - Addressable market?
    - Who is likely to acquire you? When?

## Structured design process
- Discovery
    - select a clinical challenge and dive deep
- Develop
    - explore the options; build your prototype
- Demonstrate
    - test your design and make it better

### Why does it matter?
- Most medical device recalls might have been prevented with adequate design controls
- Design Controls for Medical Devices: **21 CFR 820.30**
    - Required for all Class II and III medical devices and some Class I devices
    - begun as soon as a POC is established
    - specifies what you must do, not necessarily how
- What are **design controls**?
    - Establish procedure for design inputs, changes, outputs, and documentation
    - Establish method to determine conformity
    - Require human factors testing
    - Require structured risk analysis
- **Verification** vs. **Validation**
    - Verification: I made the product correctly
    - Validation: I made the correct product

## 15 weeks, three phase design process
- **physics-based prototyping**
- **most critical module (MCM)**
    - parts that fail and _ruin the product_

### Projects vetted by the 6.025 team
- Possible in 15 weeks
- Can brainstorm ideas and get excited
- Clinician wants to work with you

### Covid era restrictions
- access to patients is limited
    - **simulation center** (operating room (OR)) may be limited

## Labs
- Kinematic coupling lab (02/25)
- EKG lab (03/11)

## Weekly meetings
- What have you done?
- What are you planning to do?
- What help do you need?

## Communication assignments
1. Mission statement
2. Strategy presentation
3. Concept presentation
4. MCM presentation
5. Design presentation
6. Executive summary
7. Journal paper

## Classes of products
- Class I (minimal risk, 47%)
    - bandaids, urine bags
- Class II (moderate risk, 43%)
    - Some monitoring devices, surgical tools
    - 510K equivalent to existing device
    - Pre-market notification
- Class III (serious risk, 10%)
    - pacemarkers, implants

## Deterministic design and peer review
- Peer review is better than meeting all together and doing it at once
- **PREP**. peer review evaluation process

## Five P's of Prior art
1. patents
2. papers
3. products
4. presentations
5. people

## Design process
- FRDPARRC
    - functional requirements
        - what your solution **MUST** do to accomplish the mission
    - design parameters
        - loads, force, torque, etc.
        - materials
        - power source
        - duty cycle
        - interface
        - budget/costs
    - analysis
    - references
    - risks
    - countermeasures
- strategies
- **Pugh chart**
- concepts
    - specific designs
    - mechanisms
    - circuits
    - CAD designs
    - etc
- MCM and analysis
- Risks and countermeasures
