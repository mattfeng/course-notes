# Lecture 1. Welcome to Medical Device Design

## Key questions for new technologies
- the **medical device tripod**
    - Clincal need
    - Technical feasibility
    - Business case
- Questions
    - What is the unmet clinical need?
    - Why is the current tech insufficient?
    - What is the clinical burden of proof?
    - What technologies already exist?
    - How much better do you need to be?
    - What is your biggest tech risk?
    - What is your regulatory path?
    - Who pays? Patient, doctor, hospital, insurer?
    - Will it make money? Save money? Cost more?
    - Addressable market?
    - Who is likely to acquire you? When?

## Structured design process
- Discovery
    - select a clinical challenge and dive deep
- Develop
    - explore the options; build your prototype
- Demonstrate
    - test your design and make it better

## 15 weeks, three phase design process
- **physics-based prototyping**
- **most critical module (MCM)**
    - parts that fail and _ruin the product_

### Projects vetted by the 6.025 team
- Possible in 15 weeks
- Can brainstorm ideas and get excited
- Clinician wants to work with you

### Covid era restrictions
- access to patients is limited
    - **simulation center** (operating room (OR)) may be limited

## Labs
- Kinematic coupling lab (02/25)
- EKG lab (03/11)

## Weekly meetings
- What have you done?
- What are you planning to do?
- What help do you need?
