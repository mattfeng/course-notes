# Lecture 4. Fundamentals 1, 2, 3; Library Resources

- teams are critical
  - another team member might know how to do the analysis of your design
- use **big sheets of paper**
- **reciprocity rules**
  - what is the opposite approach?
  - opposite of linear motion is rotational motion
- run a **first order analysis** _first_
- **Saint-Venant's principle**
  - to have control of an object, apply constraints over several characteristic dimensions
- **Abbe's principle**
  - atomic force microscopy takes advantage of Abbe error
- deformation $\delta = \frac{Fl^3}{3EI}$
- slope $\alpha = \frac{Fl^2}{2EI}$
- deformation with a moment
  - $\delta = \frac{Ml^2}{2EI}$
  - $\alpha = \frac{Ml}{EI}$
- **Maxwell and reciprocity**
  - Crab flexure
  - **reversal**
- **Self-principles**
- **Stability**
  - neutral $\to$ instability $\to$ stable
- **Symmetry**
  - try both symmetric and asymmetric!
  - thermal errors $\to$ bowing $\to$ Abbe error
- **Parallel axis theorem**
  - stress $\sigma = \frac{M}{Ik}$
    - $k$. distance to neutral axis
    - $I$. moment of inertia
- **Structural loop**
- **Preload**
- **Centers-of-action**
  - **center of stiffness**
    - twist (Abbe error)
  - **center of friction**
  - attach actuator at the center of stiffness; minimize tilt
- **Kinematic couplings**
  - **Hertz contact theory**
    - design sphere so that it doesn't deform the grooves
    - grooves along the **angle bisectors**
  - draw the contact normals; need to form a closed shape
  - Canoe spheres

  - FOUP (front opening unified pod)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOUP
- **Elastically averaged design**
  - have infinite constraints, so error in any one will be averaged out
  - prevents tilt (through center of stiffness)
