# 6.025 Proposed projects

## P1. Development of a low-cost capillary electrophoresis for cancer diagnosis in LMIC
- Accurate and timely diagnosis of cancer is critical to improving patient outcomes and informing epidemiological reporting which impacts on patient outcomes and global health priorities.
- We have developed a low-cost genetic platform to diagnosis lymphoma.
    - Its adoption is limited by the availability and expense of current **capillary electrophoresis machines** which are needed to process the sample.
- We propose the development of a low-cost capillary electrophoresis machine.

## P2. Self-administration devices for therapeutic foams
- We have developed and tested the delivery of novel Gas Entrapping Materials (GEMs) for the delivery of CO through the GI tract. These simple systems were designed using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-classified Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) components to support rapid clinical translation.
- CO-GEMs delivered high therapeutic levels of carbon monoxide locally and systemically and reduced inflammation-associated damage in animal models of colitis. These CO-GEMs offer entirely new modalities for the delivery of CO, enabling a spectrum of safe, effective, and potent delivery methods for enhanced translatability.
- To enable translation of this system to patient care, we are seeking a solution to safely deliver pre-defined doses of rectal CO-GEMs to patients with IBD. Ideally, the solution would enable patients to self-administer in the comforts of their own home. Furthermore, the solution would eliminate any possible risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

## P3. Improved Hydrocephalus ETV Procedure
- Hydrocephalus is a condition arising from the build-up of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which causes swelling of the brain, particularly in infants.
- The Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) procedure punctures the third ventricle allowing CSF to exit and be reabsorbed. This opening (stoma) can close up in 9 to 50% of patients within 6 months.
- This project envisions creating a deployable stent or device that will maintain the stoma as well as facilitate condition monitoring.

### Questions
- Is closing of the stoma good or bad?

## P4. Building a More Ergonomic Mini C-Arm
- Mini C-arms are used in virtually all surgeries involving fractures of the upper and lower extremities and are commercially available from about 4 companies.
- Because the operative field is so small, the X-ray tube often gets in the way of seeing the fracture so the C-arm has to be moved multiple times.

### Questions
- What is a C-arm?

## P5. Pre-hospital noninvasive identification of large pneumothorax
- In traumatic injury, a large pneumothorax (collapsed lung) can lead to rapid respiratory and hemodynamic compromise and death in the prehospital and emergency department setting.
- Current practice relies on physical examination (auscultation) to identify these injuries which is unfortunately fraught with error, particularly in the often noisy and chaotic pre-hospital setting.
- Clinical protocols adopted from battlefield management encourage empiric needle decompression of the chest (placing a needle into the chest wall to decompress a potential pneumothorax) if there is any suspicion that a pneumothorax is present.
- Unfortunately in the civilian population, however, this empiric practice commonly leads to unnecessary needle decompressions: when a pneumothorax is suspected and treated, but was never actually present.
    - This is not only a painful and dangerous invasive procedure, but it also mandates the subsequent placement of an even more invasive and painful chest tube once the patient reaches the emergency department. 
- In the modern emergency department setting, bedside ultrasound and chest xray imaging are used to identify the presence or absence of a pneumothorax, but in the pre-hospital setting no such tool exists.
- The clinical challenge is to **noninvasively detect the presence or absence of a large pneumothorax**. If successful, this tool would transform the pre-hospital care of traumatic patients, reducing the morbidity associated with unnecessary needle decompression or missed pneumothoraces. 

### Questions
- What does it mean to _decompress_ a pneumothorax? Why do we need to _decompress_?
    - Remove pressure from pleural space?

## P6. Facilitating a Screen and Treat Approach in Cervical Cancer
- Cervical cancer, caused by infection of the human papilloma virus (HPV), is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide (>300,000 women annually).
- Recent World Health Organization guidelines have advocated for a "screen and treat approach" in low- and middle-income countries in which women would be diagnosed and immediately treated when possible.
- Per the guidelines, initial screening can be facilitated by
    - HPV PCR (most ideal method), or
    - visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid.
- Any individuals who screen positive would be triaged to determine eligibility of **ablative therapy**, which is conducted with visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid.
- We would like to partner with engineering students to develop a device that:
    - could visualize the cervix
    - apply acetic acid
    - facilitate easy assessment of lesions that can be ablated (many people doing visual inspection with acetic acid in LMICs are community health workers and not physicians)
    - ablate early cancers

## P7. Ultra-Low-cost Spark Plug CT Scanner for Intra-op Lumpectomy Specimen Evaluation
- After a breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer, a **lumpectomy specimen** needs to be examined to make sure that the entire cancer has been taken out.
- It would be nice to have a small, desktop CT in the OR that can produce tomographic images of the specimen to show the surgeon if the cancer is present at the specimen margin.
- With this type of intra-op information, the surgeon can expand the surgical resection margin and avoid re-exploration and repeat surgery.

### Questions
- What is a lumpectomy specimen?

## P8. A model for testing a Near Infra Res Sensor for detecting Necrotizing Enterocolitis
- Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at an elevated risk of developing **necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)**, an ischemic process in the intestine that portends a distinctly high morbidity and mortality in the CHD population.
- We are working on a device that employs and further develops near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) into a novel abdomen-worn NIRS sensor that monitors the intestinal vascular bed in pediatric patients.
- With this project we aim to build and test a benchtop model that will allow us to determine ideal emitter-detector distances to be integrated into our device design.

### Questions
- **Ischemia** is restricted blood flow.
- How does this NIRS sensor help detect NEC?

## P9. Patient friendly design of eye medication delivery
- Eye drops are the most common modality for delivering medication to the eye.
    - They have many favorable qualities, including
        - easy on/easy off dosing, and
        - the possibility of self-administration.
- Eye drops, however, can be uncomfortable to administer, and are associated with high rates of non adherence.
- Improper technique risks injury and infection to the eye
- Build a solution for topical eye medication administration that is comfortable, reliable, and easy to use for all patients.

## P10. Monitoring efficacy of cancer patient treatment
- An important factor in personalized cancer treatment, and in improvement of novel cancer treatment modalities in general, is the ability to monitor the efficacy of treatment at the cellular level.
- Monitoring of the efficacy of cancer patient treatment at cellular level by measuring dielectric properties of cells using macroscopic electrical field tomography (EFT) requires a smart electrode array design and materials.

### Questions
- How does measuring dielectric properties of cells help monitor treatment efficacy?
- What is the project?

## P11. Proton therapy patient positioning
- Proton therapy provides a highly focused alternative to traditional radiation therapy, where energy is delivered directly to the target site.
- Unlike radiation therapy, this requires precise patient positioning and immobilization on a treatment couch.
- When interference between the couch or patient and the rotating gantry occurs, the patient must be repositioned and re-registered.
- The goal of this project is to improve procedure planning, detect potential impacts and optimize patient positioning.

## P12. Left atrial appendage closure
- Atrial fibrillation (afib) is a special case of higher heart rate specifically located in the left atrium of the heart.
- In some cases, this can result in the formation of blood clots in the left side of the heart or in a residual anatomical feature on the left atrium called the left atrial appendage (LAA).
- To respond to this condition, Boston Scientific released the Watchman family of devices for LAA closure or occlusion (called LAAC or LAAO procedures).
- The current device has been incrementally improved, using targeted tweaks to the fundamental design platform.
- To move beyond current performance, more disruptive and systematic changes to the platform are required to achieve and demonstrate advancement beyond a device that is already quite successful.
- This project proposes to reimagine the entire LAAC procedure and device. The solution should maintain safety, prevent clots and be easy to deploy and secure.

## P13. Spacesuit Cooling Unit
- Astronauts use portable cooing units to circulate air inside their spacesuits between donning their suits and entering the capsule.
- Today's Portable Atmosphere Ventilators (PAVs) are Apollo-era, liquid-air relics loaned to SpaceX by NASA. They require refilling after every launch attempt at considerable expense and have qualitative adjustments on flow rate with entirely analog displays.
- The desired project would be to design a new and improved, SpaceX-owned, portable cooling unit for the spacesuits.	

## P14. Drug storage & Reminder Device
- Therapy regimes for drugs that must be taken multiple times per/day or for acute “SOS” use pose challenges related to _carrying the drugs_ and _administration and disposing of syringes and needles_, which can hinder adherence.
- This is especially the case for drugs that come in lyophilized and prefilled syringes form.
- This project sponsored by Takeda aims to re-imagine the workflow and provide patients a smart device/packaging/storage solution that improves user experience and is applicable to a range of medications and formats.
