## Capillary electrophoresis background
- https://www.colby.edu/chemistry/CH332/laboratory/Agilent%20CE%20Primer.pdf
- 25 to 75 µm narrow-bore capillaries
- output plot: **electropherogram**
- Separation by electrophoresis is obtained by differential migration of solutes in an electric field. In CE, electrophoresis is performed in narrow-bore capillaries, typically 25 to 75 µm inner diameter (id), which are usually **filled only with buffer**.
- electric fields of **100 V/cm to 500 V/cm**
- **plug**. refers to [**plug flow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_flow)
- Since narrow capillaries are themselves anticonvective, gel media are not essential to perform that function. This allows the performance of free-solution (or open tube) electrophoresis, as well as the use of traditional gel media in the capillary.
- **covalent wall passivation**. coating a material so that it becomes "passive", less readily affected/corroded by the environment.

### Electroosmotic flow[^eof]
- **electroosmotic flow**. the motion of liquid induced by an applied potential across a fluid conduit.
  - $\veof = \mu_e E$
    - $\veof$. ion velocity
    - $E$. applied electric field
    - $\mu_e$. electrophoretic mobility
- **solute's total velocity**: sum of **electrophoretic velocity (ep)** and **electroosmotic flow (eof)**
  - $\vtot = \vep + \veof$

### Separation efficiency[^plates]
- column efficiency is a measure of the extent of band broadening
- **theoretical plates**
  - $N = \dfrac{L}{H}$
    - $L$. column length
    - $H$. height of theoretical plate
  - more theoretical plates gives better column efficiency

### Sample injection
- https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-94-009-1561-9_2.pdf
- electrokinetic injection
  - quantity of analyte injected depends on its own mobility $\to$ not defined aas a specific sample volume
- spontaneous injection: Improved high-speed capillary electrophoresis system using a short capillary and picoliter-scale translational spontaneous injection (Zhang 2014)
  - not super relevant because we need to use electrokinetic

## Polymers and pumping
- **polymer is 6% PVP**, not polyacrylamide
  - mixed with TBE
  - also known as **POP**
- 200 µL PCR tube with 1-2mm slot on bottom
- Different possible polymers
  - https://web.stanford.edu/group/barronlab/PubPdfs/1993-2000/electrophoresis2000_21_4096.pdf
- Samples are injected electrokinetically because the gel provides too much resistance for hydrodynamic sampling[^eof].

## Heating requirements
- https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/4401661.pdf
- Oven: Maintains uniform capillary array temperature.
- To insure optimal separation and maintain denaturation of the DNA, the capillaries are thermally controlled in the oven and in the detection cell. The oven has a Peltier heat unit and fan-circulated air. The Peltier can heat and cool the oven to maintain sub-ambient temperatures, which are useful for nondenaturing applications such as SSCP (Single-strand conformation polymorphism). 
- 60C for POP7 and POP4 polymers
- 50C for POP6 polymer
