# Lecture 6. 

## Strategies vs. concepts
- **strategy**.
  - broad approach that can be analyzed at a high level.
  - independent of a specific design
  - analysis piece of FRDPARCC
- **concept**.
  - specific design that embody one or more strategies
  - requires sketching a mechanism
  - incorporates the MCM (most critical module)

## Strategy presentations
- 5 minutes
1. Brief problem recap
2. Mission statement
3. Functional requirements
4. Key design parameters
5. Three main strategies
6. Analysis that will help you select
7. Open questions/discussion

## Teamwork
- structure, connections, tips, heuristics
- teamwork implies a fundamental balance between _autonomy_ and _accomplishment_

### Five axes of individual contribution
1. Skills, abilities, and knowledge
2. Keeping team on task
3. Expecting quality
4. Getting work done
5. Playing well with others

### How discussions work
- Open idea $\to$ rational exploration $\to$ close ideas as necessary

### Why teams underperform
1. scheduling: shared knowledge and delegation
2. disappearing person: increased engagement
3. skills and abilities mismatches: continuous learning
4. minimizing intra-team conflict: focus on goals, foster environment for productivity

- need to keep people **on Zoom** in the loop

### Fix easy things first
- procrastination index
- meeting promptness
- **agenda**, deliverables, follow-up
- facilitator, time keeper, note taker
- "yes and" rather than "no bue"
- talk about _ideas_ instead of people
- build trust early

### How to make a good team
- **Mentor others and help them grow**

### Presentations
- first presentations are to **solicit information from audience**
  - mission statement
  - strategy presentation
  - concept presentation
  - MCM presentation
  - design presentation
  - journal article
  - executive summary
- know these for every presentation
  - audience
  - purpose
  - message
  - structures
  - content
  - genre
  - medium

### FRDPARCC
- functional requirements
- design parameters

### For next week's presentation
- 12 minutes (talk for 6 minutes)
- What we need, to tell you
- Convey value added
- Hand drawing useful
- audience response mandatory

### Mission statement
1. What are you doing?
2. For whom?
3. Why? (impact)
4. How? (optional)
