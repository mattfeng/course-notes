## Nakul Singh, Patient friendly design of eye medication delivery
- eye drop
    - pros
        - self-administration
        - minimal systemic side effects
        - flexible dosing scheudles
        - quick cessation at the time of adverse events
    - cons
        - tedious
        - uncomfortable
        - fine motor skills
        - vision
        - neck mobility
        - poor adherence
        - incorrect dosage
        - trauma to ocular surface
        - bottle tip contamination
- current solutions
    - squeeze bottle holder
        - doesn't support vials/alternative tip types
        - more than one drop delivered
- incorrect dosage is a _cost issue_ rather than a _medical issue_

## Piotr Zygmanski, Monitoring efficacy of cancer patient treatment
- [NanoKnife](https://www.angiodynamics.com/product/nanoknife-system/)
    - nano(electro)poration
- session to session variation because of the set up can alter interpretation of scans
- problem
    - how to construct and attach a system of electrodes
    - in a practical and repeatable way
    - data acquisition
        - compact, minimal wiring
- initial position matches anatomy, but later
    - would have to accomodate chest, limbs, abdomen
- done in the office

## Shruti Parikh, Drug storage & reminder device
- focuses on 
    - GI, rare diseases, oncology, neuro diseases
- light mixing using a mixer
- safe disposal of the syringe or needle tip

## Alon Dagan, Pre-hospital noninvasive identification of large pneumothorax
- current only diagnostic method is stethoscope and ears (in prehospital setting)
    - detect difference between two sides of body
- pneumosomics; high false positive rate
- in hospitals
    - chest xray
    - bedside ultrasound
    - butterfly handheld ultrasound (maybe be a bit too powerful)
- how to test within class
    - mannequin or model scenario
    - ultrasound manneqiun
    - mechanical simulator of pneumothorax
    - sheep lab
- machine learning approach
    - classify whether or not the sounds are different or the same

## Danielle Sen, Building a Novel Monitor for Infants with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)
- perfect repair doesn't always yield a perfect outcome
- better monitoring leads to better results
- NEC (intestinal death)
    - from poor regional $\ce{O2}$ delivery
- NEC is detected too late (after symptoms already appear)
- existing NIRS devices not optimized for NEC
    - no specificity
    - abdomen $\neq$ head
- quantitative measurements (need to be absolute/standardized)
- **need to be able to modify the light path so we know what we're scanning**

## Nagaaki Kamiguchi, Proton therapy patient positioning
- Proton therapy is one of the few radiation therapies that has **range**
- takes registration image and Xray and computes **correction vector**
- **gantry**

## Jay Connor, Building a More Ergonomic Mini C-Arm
- How heavy is the C-arm?
    - 200 lbs
