# Lecture 3. Project presentations 2

- Most electric toothbrushes are Class 1 because they make a medical claim of improving oral hygiene.
- Breast implants are Class 3 because of lawsuits (silicone injections leaking are dangerous).

## P1. Development of a low-cost capillary electrophoresis for cancer diagnosis in LMIC
- *DxTerity* (Sam Dixon)
- How do we diagnose cancer now?
  - Pathology
    - Running pathology tests are expensive
  - RNA/DNA sequencing
  - There are a **high income paradigm**
- Most cancer patients don't get diagnosed (LMI areas).
- Without diagnosis, it is hard to determine which treatments to purchase and distribute.
- **Most income paradigm: just expression profile**
  - 94% accuracy from nucleic acid data only
- The need
  - **A cheaper capillary electrophoresis detection**
- Capillary electrophoresis
  - Method for measuring fluorescently-labeled DNA fragments
  - Fiberglass tube
  - Apply voltage across capillary
  - Uniquely sized fluorescent probes complementary to amplicons
  - Laser causes fluorescence, measure signal intensity with camera
- Functional requirements
  - Laser is probably the most expensive part of the instrument
  - Calibrated detection of the **G5 dye set**
  - Cost target: $1000
  - Minimal: Single capillary
  - Ideal: Multiple capillaries for simultaneous sample run from 8-stripe tubes to 96 well plates

### Questions
- Capillary electrophoresis is more consistent and reusable than gel electrophoresis.

## P3. Improved Hydrocephalus ETV Procedure
- Current interventions
  - VPS (ventriculo-peritoneal shunt)
    - brain to abdomen to drain CSF
    - infection starts from outside the brain and moves up to the brain
  - Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV)
    - lower overall complication rate profile
    - virtually no infection risk
- Clinical need: **prevent restenosis**
  - device implantation to hold stoma open
- _in vivo_ model of hydrocephalus
  - Soft robotic actuator implanted in the brain ventricles

### Questions
- What causes hydrocephalus?
- How to handle growing brain?
- How do we accommodate for brain growth?
- Functional requirements
  - Diameter: 6mm
  - Channel length: 3mm (fit in 3mm channel, expand to 9mm)
  - Hole created: 8-9mm (because of balloon inflated)

## P2. Self-administration devices for therapeutic foams
- Leo Otterbein, BIDMC, HMS
- Physiological differences between patients for CO treatments
  - Used for **IBD**
- Currently administered using a **whipping siphon**
  - Unable to provide discrete, safe dosing in a patient's home
- Functional requirements
  - 200 PSI device capable of safe, metered dose delivery of rectal foams for patients with pouchitis
- Needs to tolerate temperatures between -20 $\degC$ to 40 $\degC$
- Would be pressurized and filled at a different site (not at home).
- Dosage: $100$ to $\pu{300 mL}$

## P7. Ultra-Low-cost Spark Plug CT Scanner for Intra-op Lumpectomy Specimen Evaluation
- Rajiv Gupta, MD, PhD (Neuroradiology) (MGH, HMS)
- CT scan currently: $1 million to $3 million
- Building an xray tube
  - Electrons hit anode, xrays are emitted
- $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$ atm vacuum
- Resolution of images come from **detector**
- _Very well spoken, knowledgeable_
- Size: **1 in** diameter lumps
- What species to test on?
  - Image on meat from butcher shop

## P12. Left atrial appendage closure
- Afib
  - Symptoms: palpitations, chest pain, fatigue
  - Major complication: stroke
- 9/10 Afib clots orgiinal in the **left atrial appendage (LAA)**
- Current treatments
  - Anti-rhythmic drugs
  - Blood chemistry drugs
    - Blood thinners
    - Anticoagulants
    - Work _too_ well
  - Electrophysiology ablation
    - Doesn't always work; may need repeat procedures
  - Removal of LAA
    - Requires open heart surgery
- **Watchman FLX**
  - implanted transfemorally
- competition from **Abbott**
- Problems that need to be solved
  - Patients are different sizes
- Testing with benchtop models

## P6. Facilitating a Screen and Treat Approach in Cervical Cancer
- Shortcoming of existing solutions
  - Absence of an exam table with stirrups in the field or in a home
  - Stigma associated with traditional pelvic exams
  - Challenges in interpretation, depending on operator's training
- Functional requirements
  - Visualize cervix with acetic acid
    - Comfortable
    - Address stigma: self-administration
    - Good enough resolution to enable interpretation on/off site
  - Ideal
    - low-cost, reusable
    - at-home (telehealth)
- _Well spoken as well_
