# Lecture 8. Strategy Presentations 2

## Reasons for deflection
- asperities (rough edges on surfaces)
- mechanical adjustment
- material compression

## Strategy presentations

### Cervical
- high income countries
  - pap smears
  - biopsy
  - colposcope
- existing solutions
  - next-gen speculum
  - next-gen colposcope
  - speculum + colposcope
- Do we need camera? Can we detect using a chemical process?
- How will you make the device easily sanitized? Or will it be disposable? Is a VIA enough to diagnose cervical cancer (is other subtyping necessary?)

### Drug storage
- How will you scope out the challenge for a certain subset of patients? It might be simpler to have different cases of different needs.

### Appendages
- LAA opening is usually 2-3 cm
- What are the downstream complications of each of the methods? Especially for future heart surgeries.

### Hydrocephalus (ETV)
- How is the device tested?
- How will you model growth of tissue around the foreign device?

### Pneumothorax (PNX, PTX)
- Strategies
  - Imaging
  - Acoustics
  - Time of flight and transmittance
- Have you found quantitative datasets of tension pneumothorax sounds?

### Proton therapy
- If you use an optimization approach, what is the dataset for training?
