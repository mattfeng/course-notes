## Healthcare Value Propositions: Reimbursement for Novel Medical Technologies
- Charles Matthews, ClearView Healthcare Partners

### Agenda
- Goals and objectives
- Understanding reimbursement
- Future of reimbursement
- Reimbursement strategy and tactics

### Why does reimbursement matter?
- **reimbursement**: will this product be used by **providers** and paid for by **payers**?
- reasons by reimbursement can be complex
  1. payment paradigm doesn't allow for adequate value capture
  2. technology's value runs counter to financial incentives
      - e.g. **fee-for-service** instead of **clinical outcomes**
  3. complex and opaque reimbursement systems

### Case study 1: Non-invasive screening test for progression of a late-onset disease
- Problems
  1. Non-invasive = low-cost = not much money to make.
  2. No sample to send to lab: doctor is incentivized to give test and get paid (usually, lab gets paid, which removes the incentives problem).
  3. At-risk means that the payer may not have to deal the problem later. Why pay for screening now then?
  4. Medicare does not typically cover screening.

### FDA approval vs. payer approval
- payers care about **cost**, which means that interests are different
- need to tackle both barriers

### Sources of payment
- need to consider the **payer mix** (who is the payer, and how much do they pay?)

### Main components of reimbursement
- need to balance the components for success
- Coverage
  - Medical necessity
  - Investigational/experimental?
- Coding
  - How does the provider describe the product/procedure?
  - Does a code already exist?
- Payment
  - How much is paid for the technology?

### Technique: Follow the money
- Who pays the producer manufacturer?
  - Physicians, distributors, patients?
- Willingness to bear financial risk?
- How does product change current dollar flow?

### Paid for separately?
- Not separately reimbursed = avoid reimbursement entirely
  - Inpatient hospital devices, drugs, and diagnostics
  - Devices that are components of larger procedures/supplies

### Future of reimbursement
- Moving towards **value for money**, which emphasizes **evidence-based medicine** (**value-based medicine**)

### Integrating reimbursement concepts
- Building value proposition
  - Know your market
  - Access current landscape
  - Data development
- Implementation
  - Coverage
  - Coding
  - Payment

## Regulations
- Mary Christian, SVP at Lyndra Therapeutics

### FDA Organizational Framework
- think about FDA approval by looking at FDA organization

### Combination products
- handled by the **Office of Combination Products**
- increasing influence due to biological/chemical engineering combinations
- e.g. drug-eluting **stent**
