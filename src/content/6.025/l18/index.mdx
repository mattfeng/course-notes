### Preclinical and clinical models
- simulations
- phantoms synthetic approximation of organs
- tissue
  - _in vitro_: cell lines
  - _ex vivo_: fresh tissues from animals and cadavers
- _in vivo_
  - small animals: rodents
  - large animals: pigs
  - humans

### Who oversees experimental work with tissue, animals, and humans?
- Cell lines
  - EHS
  - CAD/ESCRO
- Animals
  - IACUC@MIT
- Human
  - IRB
    - COUHES

### History
- Doctor's Trial at the Nuremberg Trials
- Syphillis treatment
- Henrietta Lacks
- Lab animals
  - 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act
  - 1970 Animal Welfare Act
  - 1985 Animal Welfare Act (IACUC formation)

### Tissue/cell lines
- Guidance: ISO 10993-1

#### Tissue: _in vitro_ toxicity evaluation
- experiment 1: 
- conformable electronics: can cells grow on the material?
  - leeching studies

#### Where to get materials?
- ATCC
- local (ask collaborators)

### Tissue: _ex vivo_ applications
- Interaction with tissue
- Using tissue for scaffolds/models
