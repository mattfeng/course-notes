## Electronics
- Capacitance
  - Keep voltage same
- Inductors
  - Keep current same
- 1Nxxx: **diodes**
- 2Nxxxx: **transistors**
- **mil**. thousandths of an inch
- **IF**. intermediate frequency
- **single pole single throw (spst)**
- **single pole dual throw (spdt)**
- **transistors** and **MOSFETs** control big things with small things
- **diodes**. reverse voltage protection

### Voltage
- 120VAC is RMS: 340pp (peak to peak)
- RMS is the amount of **DC** voltage needed to provide the same amount of energy

### Resistors
- **E12 series**
  - 12 values in between each decade

### Capacitors
- Usually 1µF (small bypass); 10µF (large bypass)
- All capacitors have **maximum voltage ratings**
- Ceramic for small, electrolytic for big

### Inductors
- Voltage can spike when turning devices on and off
- Motors act like inductors

### Diodes
- modeled as open circuit in one direction and a short in the other (with a 0.6 volt drop)

### EKG Lab
- 0.5V to 2.0V sensed on the skin
- RR interval approximates heart rate
