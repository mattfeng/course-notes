## Electronics, Part 2

### Agenda
- ADC: Bits and resolution
- PWM
- DAC
- uC
- Real world

### Notes

#### Op-amps
- what can they do?
  - addition
  - subtraction
  - multiplication
  - division
  - integration
  - differentiation
  - buffering
  - etc.
- Op-amp golden rules
  - V+ and V- are the same
  - No current enters or leaves the triangle

#### ADC
- real world is analog
- digital is easier to compute on

#### Quantization
- Dithering
- Robert's technique

#### Arduino, Teensyduino
- Teensy 3.2 Development Board
- USB to Serial chip: CH340G

#### ECG/EKG
- ~5mV, low frequency

#### SMT
- ICs: SOIC: small outline integrated circuit
- Transistors: small outline transistor
- BGA: ball grid array

## Syringe pumps
- Syringe infusion pumps are used to administer highly concnetrated drugs or antibiotics from a syringe (anywhere between 1 and 50 mL)
- types of SPs
  - lab syringe pumps
  - medical infusion pumps
