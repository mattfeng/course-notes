- growing too fast can let you grow to be _too big to fail_
- **asset.** an asset is a sequence of current and future cashflows
    - $A_t = \{CF_t, CF_{t+1}, CF_{t+2}...\}$
    - the point in time matters
    - _always draw a timeline to visualize the timing of cashflows
- the two factors that make finance interesting: **time** and **uncertainty**
- **numeraire.** the base or currency we use as standard for analysis
- **net present value (NPV) operator.**
    - $CF_0 + \frac{\$_1}{\$_0} CF_1 + \frac{\$_2}{\$_0} CF_2$
    - the exchange rate can be _found via the market_
        - how much is someone willing to pay for $\$1$ in $x$ time?
