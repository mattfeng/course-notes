# L9. Microbiome

## Basics of the microbiome
- David Kong, MIT Media Lab

### The human microbiota
- Mass of microbes on/in body: 3 pounds
- We inherit ~2-20 million genes from the microbiome

### Tools for studying the microbiome
- sequencing
- mouse models
  - gnotobiotic ("germ-free") mouse

### Metagenomics
- Two main types
  - 16S rRNA sequencing
    - has constant and variable region
    - can't look at viruses, fungi
    - can't look at all genes present; just those we flank
  - Shotgun metagenomic sequencing
    - pro: captures sequences from all organisms
    - con: expensive

### Gut-brain axis
- Microbiota impact serotonin production (SCFA)

### Lab on a chip systems
- the tooling to create is extremely difficult to create
- SHIME: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29787058/
- Gut-on-a-chip

## BioBot Analytics: What can we learn from our collective microbiome?
- Mariana Matus, BioBots
- have been working in the space for over a decade
- **sewage is an important source of public health information**
- as far as we know, every pathogen will be shed into the fecal matter
- less than 1% of sequence data is human DNA
- products
  - opioid consumption monitoring
