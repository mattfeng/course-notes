# Module 3: Lab Automation

## [Alex Hadik](https://www.alexhadik.com/)
- science today is
  - manual
  - hard to replicate
  - brain constrained

### Manual
1. Scientists spend a lot of time moving liquid around between containers
2. Manual pipetting is error prone
3. When something goes wrong, it's impossible to go back to see what happened

### Replication
1. Papers rarely contain information to faithfully replicate experiments.
2. Tiny variables (such as lab humidity) can alter outcomes.
3. Methodologies change over time, and so too can results.

### Brain constrained
1. The scientists can only complete experiments they can keep track of manually.
2. Branching logic, dynamic changes, large scale/throughput and other complexities aren't possible to execute.
3. Experiments can't efficiently run in a closed loop.

### Paradigm shift
- Automation
  - [Hamilton](https://www.hamiltoncompany.com/automated-liquid-handling)
- Experiments can be replicated
  - Encoding protocols in code
- Complex experiments
  - Programming languages can easily encode branching logic
  - Programs can interface with databases/inventory
