# Lecture 4. Protein Design: Fundamentals and Applications

## Questions
- What are the isoforms of EGFR? What are the isoform precursors?

## Part 0: Exercises
1. Answer any of the following questions
    - How many molecules of amino acids do you take with a piece of 500 grams of meat? (on average an amino acid is ~100 Daltons)
        - 
    - Why are there only 20 natural amino acids?
        - 20 amino acids was good enough for evolution
    - Why most molecular helices are right handed?
        - sterics
    - Where did amino acids come from before enzymes that make them, and before life started?
        - ?
        - RNA served as catalysts
    - What do digital databases and nucleosomes have in common?
        - they both store data
        - **nucleosome**. the basic repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin
2. Pick any protein (from any organism) of your interest that has a 3D structure and answer the following questions.
    - Briefly describe the protein you selected and why you selected it.
        - **EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)** is 
    - Identify the amino acid sequence of your protein.
        - How long is it? What is the most frequent amino acid?
        - How many *protein sequence homologs* are there for your protein? Use `pBLAST` to search for homologs and `ClustalOmega` to align and visualize them.
  - Does your protein belong to any **protein family**?
  - Identify the structure page of your protein in RCSB
    - When was the structure solved? Is it a good quality structure?
    - Are there any other molecules in the solved structure apart from protein?
    - Does your protein belong to any *structure classification family*?
  - Open the structure of your protein in any 3D molecule visualization software
    - Visualize the protein as "cartoon", "ribbon" and "ball and stick".
    - Color the protein by secondary structure. Does it have more helices or sheets?
    - Color the protein by residue type. What can you tell about the distribution of hydrophobic vs hydrophilic residues?
    - Visualize the surface of the protein. Does it have any "holes" (aka *binding pockets*)?
