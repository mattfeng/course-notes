    - Jeff Hasty modified program to synchronize
- **operon.** a unit of DNA containing a cluster of genes that are controlled by a single promoter
- **Phosphoramidite DNA synthesis cycle**
  - 5 minute cycles: **500,000 bp per year**
  - **protection group chemistry**; nucleotides need protection group to stop polymerization after one step

- **Next generation (chip-based) DNA synthesis**
  - building in parallel
  - up to ~1M oligos/chip (different sequences!)
  - CMOS
    - use CMOS chip to deprotect (charge causes $\ce{H+}$ to form which deprotects the DNA sequence under construction)

    - Twist Biosciences
    - Droplets on wafer
- Error correction
  - 99.5% accurate (500 bp max)
  - **MutS repair system**
