# Lecture 3. Industry synthetic biology and open source synthetic biology: Bioproduction, DNA storage

## Homework review
- changing the agarose concentration can help improve the resolution of a gel run
- bacteria/phage RNA "clicker" to count RNA

## Lecture notes
- [Biomultimeter](https://news.mit.edu/2019/lincoln-laboratory-biomultimeter-measures-rna-protein-production-real-time-0520)
- **electropherogram**. a record or chart produced when electrophoresis is used in an analytical technique

### Drew Endy (BioBricks Foundation)
- It is possible within a human generation to get to a **flourishing** human civilization.
  - That won't happen by default.
- Biology: _joules, bits, and atoms_
- [FreeGenes](https://stanford.freegenes.org/)
  - will take over iGEM gene sourcing

#### Reflections on [2003 whitepaper](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/38455/SyntheticBiologyStudy.pdf)
- DARPA: how could we systematically
  - parts: _standardization_
  - parts: _abstraction_
  - decouple: _DNA synthesis_
- **synthesis**
  - for a time, made good process in DNA synthesis
    - Codon 
    - Gen9 ($0.10 per bp)
- **standardization**
  - a bust except in under-resourced environments
- **abstraction**
  - not too many people are thinking about it
  - CRISPR is the best example of functional abstraction
- needs capital investments to see them realized

#### Other notes
- synthetic biology is driven too much by the immediate application $\implies$ not enough investment in tool improvement
  - [InterNyet](https://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/articles/Gerovitch-InterNyet.pdf). problems of driving innovation with economics at the front
- how can we get the political energy for **standardization**?
- understanding the philosophy of your technology: [Transformations of the Human](https://tofth.org/the-school/)

#### Technology is not technology
- **a computer is not a computer** 
  - the physics is not different
  - the form factor drives who can use the technology
- **who can use a tool where is often the most impactful aspect of a tool**
  - "growing is not growing"
  - not everyone can grow

### Patrick Boyle (Ginkgo Bioworks)
- Head of Codebase for Ginkgo
- automation
  - colony picker
  - liquid handling robots
- Cronos Group
- Motif Foodworks
- Synlogic

#### How is biology programmable?
- design, build, test cycles

#### Chassis + pathway
- chassis: host strain
  - **tolerance** of desired product
  - common chasses:
    - yeast
    - E. coli
- pathway: what are the components to add?
  - **heterologous enzymes**. enzymes that need to be added
- How do you select enzymes?
  - literature
    - **biocyc.org**
    - **kegg.jp**
- **cell development kits (CDKs)**
- synlogic: **LeuD**
  - can we reduce the amount of leucine in the bloodstream?
    - SYN5941; the designed version decreased leucine levels, compared to the natural enzyme
