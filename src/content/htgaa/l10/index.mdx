  * Eat all of biotech.
  * Make the world flat for medicine
  * Enable human adaptation and evolution.
* mRNA lipid nanoparticle: first documented in 1978
* mRNA reamining technical limitations
  * repeated dosing
    * first dose primes the immune system to degrade future doses
  * longevity
    * mRNA is degraded quickly in the body
  * targeted delivery
* mRNA-encoded biologics are next
* mRNA will eat cell therapies
* mRNA foundries: where are we in mRNA manufacturing?
  * Similar to silicon chip manufacturing in the 1970s
* Smaller scale manufacturing
  * [CureVac mRNA manufacturing](https://www.curevac.com/en/technology/production/)
