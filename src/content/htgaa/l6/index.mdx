# Lecture 6. Bolt Threads, Revive and Restore

## Homework review

## Bolt threads

## Revive and Restore
- extra challenges in synbio for wildlife
  1. no control over growth conditions or what happens next
  2. need to get synthetic pathways and circuits in to the germline
  3. need to be robust to evolutionary pressures and population dynamics
  4. details and differences matter
- introducing traits through gene editing
  - create additional founders from past populations
- roadmap
  - genomic insight
  - genetic preservation
  - restoring diversity
  - facilitated adaptation
  - controlling invasives
  - de-extinction
