# Module 2. Bioproduction: plasmids, growth, measurement

## Plasmids 101
- Copy numbers: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749727/
- Antibiotic resistance genes so we can figure out which cells took up the plasmid
- **selectable marker**
  - confers a trait suitable for artificial selection
  - often when moving from chassis to chassis
- DNA for a protein of interest should be **codon-optimized** for the chassis
- Use **UniProt** and **Ensembl** to find genes to express
- **RBS**. ribosome binding site
  - **Kozak** sequence: eukaryotes
  - **Shine-Dalgarno** sequence: prokaryotes
- Benchling can automatically import plasmids from Addgene
- **intrinsic (rho-independent) termination**. process in prokaryotes to signal the end of transcription and release the newly constructed RNA molecule
- characterizing which growing conditions are best for production of pigment
