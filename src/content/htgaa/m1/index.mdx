# Module 1: Genotyping &ndash; Gels, PCR, Sequencing

## Readings

### [Assessment of Nucleic Acid Purity](https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/brochures/TN52646-E-0215M-NucleicAcid.pdf)
- for proteins, $\lambda_{\max} = \pu{280 nm}$
- for nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), $\lambda_{\max} = \pu{260 nm}$

- $A_{260}/A_{280} = \begin{cases}1.8 & \text{pure DNA}\\ 2.0&\text{pure RNA}\end{cases}$
- $A_{260}/A_{230} \in [2.0, 2.2]$; $A_{230}$ should be the trough.

- [**TE buffer (TE)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TE_buffer).
  - TE is derived from **Tris**, a common pH buffer, and **EDTA**, a molecule that chelates cations like $\ce{Mg^2+}$.
  - Used to solubilize DNA/RNA while protecting it from degradation.

### PCR
- _Taq_ vs. _Pfu_ DNA polymerase
  - _Pfu_ has higher fidelity when copying DNA
  - both heat resistant

## Design a genome edit
- Design a genome edit and describe the rationale
  - Kind of edit
    - Knockout
    - Introduction of STOP codon
    - Insertion
    - Point mutation
  - Which gene?
  - Which organism?
- Attach CRISPR gRNA sequence or TALEN
- Genome editing: studying **causality**
  - e.g. Live pigs without PERV activity
- **Ideal genome editor properties**
  1. efficient and specific
      - on-target
      - minimize off-target
  2. programmability
      - ability to target any DNA sequence
  3. ability to introduce any type of mutation
      - insertion
      - deletion
      - point mutation
  4. practical
      - easy to design and construct

### Ways to modify DNA
- Homology directed repair (HDR)
  - has part of **left cut, right cut, and new sequence**
- Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)

#### TALENs
- sequence binding via an array of TAL effector domains
  - 1 TAL for 1 nucleotide
- limitations
  - target sequence has to start with T

#### CRISPR
- **PAM**. (`NGG`) protospacer adjacent motif
  - newer editors can get rid of this requirement
- Cas9 causes a ds break

### Base editing
- around half of known pathogenic genetic variants are due to **SNV** (point mutations)

## Lab 2

### Hours
- 2:30PM-7PM
- 12-5PM, 1-6PM

### ABO blood system
- 9q34.1 to 9q
  - exon 6 contains the deletion that is found in most O alleles and results in a loss of enzymatic activity
  - exon 7 contains most of the coding sequence
- Restriction enzymes
  - KpnI
  - BstEII

### Gel
- 1% agarose
- company will do the Sanger sequencing
  - cheap, a couple of dollars
- Sanger sequencing and restriction digest are two ways of answering the **same question**
