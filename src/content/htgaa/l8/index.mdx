# Lecture 8. Measurement and Imaging

## Udit Batra
- Udit Batra, CEO of Waters Corporation
- Builds analytical instruments for quality assurance (food, water, etc.)
- Mass spectrometers currently have a measurement limit of 30 kDa
- Created mass spectrometer for high molecular weights, e.g. AAVs
  - AAVs have $M_w = \pu{3000 kDa}$

### History of measurement
- 1789: discovery of proteins
- 1868-71: discovery of nucleic acids
  - purified nucleic acids using aniline dyes
- 1900-30: "colloidal theory"
  - completely wrong
  - contrast: TV existed
- 1940: DNA/RNA distinction made
- 1944: Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: Transforming activity is in the nucleic acid
  - Year that atomic bond tested
- 1940: Pauling hypothesizes that antibodies all have the same sequence and only change shape
- 1948: Tiselius invents electrophoresis
- 1951-53: Sanger sequences insulin
  - proved definitely that insulin is a defined macromolecule
- 1956: Central dogma of molecular biology
- 1977: Introns and RNA splicing
- 1986: RNA editing
- 1993: miRNA
- 1970-80: Appreciation of importance of phosphorylation of proteins
