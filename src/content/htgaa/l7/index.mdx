# Lecture 7. Cell-free systems and sensors

## Cell-free production and synthetic cells
- Kate Adamala, University of Minnesota
  - [Build A Cell Organization](https://www.buildacell.org/)
- What factors are essential for **life**? Not the iteration of life that we are, but life _in general_.

### Why synthetic cells?
- Basic questions
  - Studying origin of life and alternative destinations in evolution
  - Understanding basic principles of life: flow of information, evolution on the molecular level
- Applied science
  - Understanding biology one pathway at a time
  - Prototyping metabolic engineering pathways
  - Making better drugs, studying diseases

### `JCVI-syn1.0`
- Kept on the genes that could not be removed without killing the cell

### Rapid prototyping of gene pathways
- Cell lysates

## Freeze-dried cell-free systems
- Dr. Peter Q. Nguyen, Wyss Institute

### Problems with living things
- Biology has requirements
  - Water
  - Energy
  - Gases
  - Pressure
  - Waste removal
  - Heat

### Cell extracts
- it is possible to do biology outside of a cell: it will metabolize, breathe

### Freeze-dried cell-free advantages
- transportability
  - shelf stable, weight reduced by 95%
- therapeutics on-demand
- rapid manufacturing
- efficient biosynthesis
- greater biosafety
- simple execution

## Cell-free protein synthesis
- Dr. Ally Huang, Biobits

### Practical concerns
- Kids have short attention spans
- Protocols need to be robust to inexperienced users
- Teachers are underfunded and prefer labs that teach fundamental concepts rather than fancy topics
