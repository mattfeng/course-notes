#### Finding ideas
- Recruit well

#### Feasibility
- Explore fast what might/might not work
    - Feel for initial successes and expand around them
    - Don't only explore one system by trying to understand it completely
- Identify the low-risk high-reward projects (takes practice)

#### The problem of designing biology
- The unreasonable effectiveness of math the physical sciences
- The unreasonable ineffectiveness of math in the biological sciences

### Principles, practices, and ethics (Megan Palmer, Stanford)
- "How to grow good"
- Biological Engineering PhD from MIT
- [Stanford Bio Policy and Leadership Initiatives](https://biopolis.stanford.edu/about)

#### What's at stake
- How do we ensure that the development of biotechnology is **overwhelmingly constructive**?
- In the process of mitigating harm, might we create new harms?
- Biology is a valuable technology
    - bioeconomy is growing faster than the overall economy
    - biotechnology helps protect us from other biology (response to diseases)
- Biotech is reorganizing work and industry $\Rightarrow$ policy needs to keep up (policy is the bottleneck)
- Why now? Events are sensitizing us to bio risks
    - Pandemics
- New governance methods are needed
    - Can no longer rely on obfuscation or keeping tools away
    - Emphasis on people
    - **governing.** shaping behavior
- Governance: who creates the norms?
    - public investments: BioMADE
    - the biotechnology regulatory community is maturing
- Options for governance
    - How do we find policies for a quickly developing field?
    - example: [Secure DNA Synthesis](https://www.weforum.org/reports/biosecurity-innovation-and-risk-reduction-a-global-framework-for-accessible-safe-and-secure-dna-synthesis-582d582cd4)
- Governance precedents and strategies
    - laws
    - safety oversight and guidelines
    - security guidelines
    - community norms
    - private (industry) standards
- Inevitably, problems arise $\Rightarrow$ **governance problems and responses**
    - question: **what do we do in response to a problem?**
    - historically, suspension of research
- experiments in growing good
    - build a **platform** for sharing resources
- general rules
    - don't do it alone, but make it yours
    - respect yourself and others (act responsibly, take responsibility)
    - if all else fails, use common sense, ask for help
- [NTI Global Biosecurity Dialogue](https://www.nti.org/about/programs-projects/project/global-biosecurity-dialogue/)

### Panel discussion (Joe Jacobson, George Church)
- other areas to source ethics from
- mRNA vaccines
    - e.g. historically, Phase I trials of flu vaccines waived or not?
- trolley problem
  - how do we get people off the tracks?

<Collapse title="Class 1 assignment">

**Describe a biological engineering application or tool you want to develop and why.**

TBD

<br />

**Describe one or more governance/policy goals related to ensuring that this application or tool contributes to an "ethical" future, like ensuring non-malfeasance (preventing harm). Break big goals down into two or more specific sub-goals.**

TBD

<br />

**Describe at least three different potential governance "actions", each presented in four sections: goal, design, assumptions, risks of failure and success.**

TBD

<br />

**Rank (with 1 as best, or N/A) each of your governance actions against the rubric of governance goals.**
