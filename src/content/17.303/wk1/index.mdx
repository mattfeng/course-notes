### Policy and Visions of Governance

- Goals:
    - Provide a working definition for public policy.
    - Outline the normative foundations of public policythrough a discusison of classical and modern liberal thought.
        - **normative** means relating to an evaluative standard (e.g. what is good/bad)
- **Definition (public policy).** What government _ought_ or _ought not_ to do, and _does_ or _does not_ do.
- **Definition (social contract).** The written and unwritten agreement stating what we want to do for each other collectively and what we want othe rmembers of society to do for us as individuals.
- **Classical liberalism**
    - Developed in 17th and 18th centuries
    - **Definition (liberal government).** Government by the people and for their individual and collective benefit.
    - John Locke, _Second Treatise on Civil Government_; a good logical starting point for classical liberalism
        - **ascendancy of individual rights**
            - individuals have **natural rights**: life, liberty, personal property
            - **Definition (state of nature).** The pregovernment condition.
        - results in **negative freedom**, freedom from interferences (by government or others) in the lives of the individual
        - role of government is very limited
        - Classic liberals believe that freedom and liberty exist in finite quantity; increase in government scope reduces freedom
        - Political scientists who use **economic theory** study what public policy **does** (economics) rather than what is **ought** to do (philosophy)
            - **Austrian School of Economics**
    - **John Stuart Mill**; classical liberals are increasingly willing to consider a role of government in maintaining equity in society
        - Locke ignored issue of socially constructed inequalities
        - social justice via some form of social welfare policy
            - e.g. affordable health care
- **Modern liberalism**
    - **Jean Jacques Rousseau**
        - individuals identify themselves through mutual association in a community
        - **Definition (positive freedom)**. the freedom to act within societal boundaries
        - **Definition (general will).** a general set of principles important to all citizens
        - general will relates to **nationalism**, whose decisions are not always good in general
    - **Immanuel Kant**
        - questioned the **metaphysical (religious-based) foundations of political philosophy**
            - why do we have natural rights?
        - need for a standard way of "seeing" (uniform understanding)
        - individuals are not born into the world equally
    - **John Rawls**, _A Theory of Justice (1971)_
        - primary assumption: individuals are **capable of reason**
        - idea of justice as fairness
        - freedom is a function of property
        - two general principles emerge
            1. **equal representation** in the voting process
            2 **difference principle**. wealth and income do not have to be equal in society, but the end result of the distribution should benefit everyone
        - **deontological approach**. no metaphysics involved
**Communitarianism**
    - less laws, more community
    - intergenerational connectedness
