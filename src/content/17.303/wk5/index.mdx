# Week 5

## Weimer and Vining, 16. Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) (p. 404)
- monetization techniques
  - **contingent valuation survey**
  - **hedonic pricing models**

### A preview: increasing alcohol taxes
- higher alcohol taxes result in
  - more tax revenue for government
  - less consumption of alcohol
    - fewer fatalities and injuries from alcohol-related incidents
    - improved health
- **four steps**
  1. identify relevant impacts
  2. monetize impacts
  3. discount for time and tisk
  4. choose among policies

### Identifying relevant impacts
- whose utility should we count when assessing costs and benefits?
- if issue of standing is central to analysis, should use **multigoal analysis** instead

#### Geographic extent
- often best to categorize externalities as internal/external to the nation for political reasons
- **fiscal externalities** transfer wealth across boundaries of local jurisdictions
  - do not appear in aggregate national social welfare (ANSW)
- **economic externalities** affect capability of people outside jurisdiction to produce/consume
  - should be considered in ANSW

#### People and preferences
- who within the jurisdiction should have standing?
- should we give more attention to particular groups?

### Monetizing impacts
- **Kaldor-Hicks criterion**. a policy should be adopted only if those who will gain could fully compensate losers and still be better off
- two concepts for estimating changes in social surplus
  1. opportunity cost
  2. willingness to pay

#### Valuing inputs: opportunity cost
- **opportunity cost**. the value of the required resources in their best alternative uses.
- **nature of the market for a resource** determines how we measure its opportunity cost
  - **efficient markets and negligible price effects**
    - opportunity cost = $P_0 \times Q$ (price times quantity used)
  - **efficient markets wiht price effects**
    - opportunity cost = expenditures - Δsocial surplus 
  - **inefficient markets**
    - opportunity cost = expenditures - Δsocial surplus 
  - don't count _suck costs_

#### Valuing outcomes: willingness to pay
- net revenue generated + Δsocial surplus

#### Estimating the demand for nonmarketed goods
- **hedonic price models**
  - difficult to find data
- **survey assessments**
  - sensitive to wording and other sample design issues
- **activity surveys**
  - survey actions, rather than statements, e.g. check how often people visit a park

### Discounting for time and risk
- use _real_ discount rate to get costs/benefits in _real_ present dollars
- use 3.5% for projects without intergenerational impacts
- using **expected value of surplus** is reasonable in practical CBA

### Choosing among policies

#### Physical and budgetary constraints
- **avoid using benefit-cost ratios** because different accounting techniques can change the ratio
- need to take into account **interactions between projects**

#### Distributional constraints
- generally accept that losers are not always compensated
- assume that on average, for any specific person, the losses average out with the gains from different policies
- if high costs are positioned on few members, perhaps the policy should be reconsidered
- practice **disaggregation**
  - can be used to predict political opposition
