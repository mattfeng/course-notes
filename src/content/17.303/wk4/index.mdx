## Week 4 Readings

### Weimer and Vining, 14. Gathering information for policy analysis (14 pages)
- almost all sources of data fall into two types: **documents** and **people**

#### Document research
- existing relevant literature
- sources of raw data
- easier to find relevant literature if the problem is more universal (e.g. national)
  - very little literature on new/emerging problems

##### Literature review
- four categories of documents
  1. journal articles, books, dissertations
  2. publications from think tanks, interest groups, consulting firms
  3. government publications and research documents
  4. popular press and blogs
- three approaches to find journal articles, books
    1. by topic/sector/field
    2. by discipline
    3. through literature with direct policy focus

### Weimer and Vining, 15. Landing on your feet: organizing your policy analysis (42 pages)

#### Analyzing yourself
- reflect on **how you do policy analysis**
- two broad categories
  - **linear**
  - **non-linear**
- **linear thinkers** need to adopt **nonlinear thinking strategies**
- **nonlinear thinkers** need to adopt **linear writing strategies**

#### Eight steps of linear thinking
- P1. Understanding the problem
- P2. Choosing and explaining relevant goals and constraints
- P3. Selecting a solution method
- S1. Choosing impact categories for goals
- S2. Concretely specifying policy alternatives
- S3. Predicting impacts of alternatives
- S4. Valuing impacts of alternatives
- S5. Assessing and recommending

##### P1<SPACE />Understanding the problem
- **assessing symptoms**
  - need to identify the **underlying causes**
  - need to find empirical basis: **data** that allows for quantification
- **framing the problem**
  - find causal links between symptoms to factors changeable through public policy
  - economics focus on utility articulation (how people use utility to make decision) and less on how utlity formation (how preferences, or utility values, are formed)
    - anthropology, psychology, and sociology
  - efficiency is **not** the only appropriate goal of public policy
  - efficiency analysis
    - is there an operational market?
    - is there a market failure?
    - if yes then no: no market intervention needed
  - framing of problems leads to models linking **policy variables** to **conditions of concern**
  - example framing: `**market externality**
- **modeling the problem**
  - behavioral models

##### P2<SPACE />Choosing and explaining relevant goals and constraints
- client doesn't always have goals; it is good to **not know them, especially in the beginning**
- efficiency can be one goal
- other goals can be: equity
  - need to be able to explain why specific goals were **included/excluded**
- other kinds of goals fall into two categories
  - **substantive**. represent values such as equity and efficiency
    - e.g. organ donors: moral values of donor and family
  - **instrumental**. conditions that increase the prospects for achieveing substantive goals
    - e.g. political feasibility
    - often enter solution analysis as **constraints** (solve up to a point, past which no value is added)

##### P3<SPACE />Selecting a solution method

##### S1<SPACE />Choosing impact categories for goals

##### S2<SPACE />Concretely specifying policy alternatives

##### S3<SPACE />Predicting impacts of alternatives

##### S4<SPACE />Valuing impacts of alternatives

##### S5<SPACE />Assessing and recommending

## Lecture 5.

### Homelessness in San Francisco
- 5180 unsheltered homeless
- 73% receive some form of government assistance (not enough for permanent shelter)
- losing jobs
- homelessness increases sharply once rent is 32% or more of median income
- Prop C: Our City, Our Home Fund
  - businesses are taxed based on gross sales
