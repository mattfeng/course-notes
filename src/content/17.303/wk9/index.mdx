# Week 9: Case studies

## Lecture 17. Wildfire disasters and policy

### Speaker
- NFPA: National Fire Protection Association
- Michele Steinberg, NFPA Wildfire Division Director

### Wildfires are part of nature
- gets rid of dead and decaying flora

### Terminology
- Fire-adapted ecosystems
- Fire-dependent ecosystem
- Fire regime
- Stand-replacing fire
- Serotinous

### Fire exclusion
- By putting out fires too early, too much undergrowth growing can eventually lead to unhealthy ecosystems and out-of-control fires

### Cost
- Six wildfires accounted for $12.35B in losses.
- **large-loss**. $10M loss in incident

### What have we learned?
- Fire department standard response time: 7 minutes.
- No fire suppression system can stop losses from large fires.

### Refocus
- Focus on mitigation/preventative actions before wildfires become large fires
- Reduce potential fire intensity that the vegetation will influence
- Reduce ignitability of structures

### WUI
- **WUI**. wildland-urban interface

### Outthink Wildfire
- Retro-fit homes and communities
- Codes, standards, and land use planning
- Training and equipment for local fire departments
- Land management
- Public education

### Policy context: what's missing?
- Local land use planning
  - Wildfires are not considered
- State and local building codes and ordinances
- Incentives/disincentives to limit construction in the most high-risk areas
- Inadequate mapping/modeling of the hazard

### Funding

#### Federal Wirefire Spending
- &gt;50 spent on suppression (rather than mitigation)

#### Infrastructure Act
- $3.4 billion FY22-FT-26 for wildfire

### Big challenges
- USFS "New Paradigm Announcement"
  - build workforce capacity
  - build large multi-jurisdictional coalitions to support work at needed scale

## Lecture 18. Budget of the US Government, Final Project
- Which numbers should we use?
- Fiscal Year (FY)
  - October to September
- Treasury releases a **Monthly Budget Review**
