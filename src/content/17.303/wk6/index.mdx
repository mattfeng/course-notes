## The ethics of counting (Deborah Stone)

### 1<SPACE/>What does it mean to count?
- How do we decide what gets counted?
- The problem with counting
  - **only way to count is through intellectual coercion: to force things into categories by ignoring their differences and ultimately, their uniqueness**
- kids don't just learn how to count; they learn how adults group things together: **classification**
- lesson 1. mixed methods aren't the answer
  - we need an external standard for evaluating all methods
- lesson 2. does the measure actually measure what it claims to measure?
  - even raw data is an _interpretation_ of a concept
- lesson 3. where did the idea for the category/concept come from?
  - study the _intellectual_ history of the concept
  - why did they start using it?
  - who did the counting and how is it done now?
- lesson 4. what did I leave out?
  - force yourself to make a list of differences you ignored

### 2<SPACE/>How do numbers get their meaning?
- lesson 5. who was in the room where it happened?
  - the ones who are measured and will be affected should have a voice
- **lesson 6.** if you're strong enough to be in a position to design a measure, you have an obligation to amplify the voices of the weak by counting what matters to them.

### 3<SPACE/>How do numbers get their authority?
- Numbers get their authority from **people who are able to exert rhetorical and political power to assign words to things and things to categories**.
- **lesson 7.** justify your cuts
  - justify how you chose what to include and exclude
  - find the history of yur assumptions
  - find who has power that has shaped your decisions
- **lesson 8.** resist the temptation to think you can resolve intractable conflicts with arithmetic
  - fractions that let you go half way aren't any better

### 4<SPACE/>How can counting change hearts and minds?
- **lesson 9.** could your measurement instrument influence the size of whatever you're measuring?
- **lesson 10.** examine the hidden curriculum of your questions
  - what are you conveying to respondents about morally and intellectually acceptable ways of thinking?

### 5<SPACE/>Are there some things we shouldn't count?
- value of a life
- political will
- why not count?
  - **intangibles are often more than the sum of their parts, which makes them nearly impossible to count**
  - the measures are infinitely malleable to get the result you want
  - arithmetic doesn't resolve value disagreements, it just disguises them
