# Week 7. 

## C5. Agenda setting
- Goals
  - Discuss how agenda setting works and how issues are framed
  - Discuss the major policy actors and their roles in setting the policy agenda
  - Use policy theories to explain agenda setting

### How does agenda setting work?
- policy agenda is a series of streams, circumstances, and activities
- **problem stream**. potential policy problems
- **policy stream**. potential solutions to problems
- **politics stream**. issues and solutions that emerge as policy outcomes
- a **focusing event** opens a **policy window** for policies to be made
  - e.g. 9/11
  - e.g. collapse of Minnesota bridge
  - e.g. Sandy Hook

### The president as agenda setter
- 1800s, presidents were **literalists**, only exercising powers in the Constitution
- 1900s saw extension of **presidential stewardship**
  - bully pulpit
  - State of the Union address

### Congress and the policy agenda
- when both congress and president are of the same political party, agenda is often reframed

### Congressional-executive relations and agenda setting
- Presidents advance agenda items that are likely to become policy

### The courts and the policy agenda
- before: **constitutionalism**
- now: **judicial positivism**. using legal reasoning to determine the substantive meaning and expected outcomes of policy
- examples of courts shaping agenda
  - Brown v. Board of Education
  - Obergefell et al. v. Hodges

### Pressure groups and agenda setting
- **think tanks**. pressure groups devoted almost solely to policy research
- **Common Cause** for car safety was one of the first noteworthy **public interest groups**

### Bureaucracy and agenda setting
- policy often needs finetuning, which is done by bureaucracy
- bureaucracy can shape policy agenda
  - e.g. EPA 2015 Clean Power Plan

### Media and agenda setting
- media can focus attention on certain problems
- social media is becoming more important in setting agenda

### Elections and the policy agenda
- **realignment** is long-lasting majority for a political party, giving tremendous ability to set agenda
- current: **dealignment**, divided government

### Cultural change and agenda setting
- as culture changes, what is deemed a risk changes, and thus policy changes as well

### Biases in political participation and agenda setting
- **target populations**
  - some groups are labelled "undeserving"

### Explaining agenda setting

#### Multiple streams theory
- the agenda-setting process is **reactive**

#### Advocacy coalition framework (ACF)
- the agenda-setting process is deliberate
- explains the agenda during stable times

## C6. Policy formation
- Goals
  - Discuss how policy is formulated
  - Identify the major participants in policy formation
  - Use policy theories to explain policy formation

### How is policy formed?
- **policy formation**. the process of using normative and empirical methods to define a policy goal, explore alternative solutions, and choose a preferred solution
- policy problems are often linked to **market failures**
- **demonstration projects** help guide large-scale policy planning efforts
- policy planning must resist **goal drift/shift**

### Major actors in policy formation
- congress, president, judiciary
- Congressional Budget Office
  - estimates dollar cost of policy implementation
- Congressional Research Service
  - policy research for Congress and congressional committees
- Government Accountability Office
  - focuses on policy evaluation and auditing

#### Presidential policy formation
- **Bureau of the Budget (BOB)**
  - president can propose a national budget annually
- **Executive Office of the President (EOP)**
  - administrative support for the president

#### Courts and policy formation
- negation of policies that don't promote fair outcomes guides policymaker's future proposals

#### Interest groups and policy formation
- may conduct policy formation through executive (president; via task forces) or courts (lawsuits)
  - can also file _amicus curiae_ briefs

#### Public bureaucracies and policy formation
- bureaucracies are run by people with political interests
- changing who is in charge of bureaucracies can change policy

#### International influences on policy formation
- globalism, "free market" capitalism often hurts small countries who are subject to international competition

#### Citizen stakeholders and policy formation
- citizen formed policy: **bottom-up policymaking**, **grassroots movement**
- important venues for citizen participation
  - **citizen advisory boards**
  - **collaborative policymaking**

#### Policy entrepreneurs, change drivers, ideological drivers and policy formation
- policy entrepreneurs
  - Koch brothers
  - George Soros
- change drivers seek to shape the formation process through network building
- ideological drivers focus on narrowly defined issues

### Demographic changes and policy formation
- examples of demographic shifts
  - divorced families
  - children born to unwed parents
  - immigrants
  - "graying" of America

### Explaining policy formation

#### Advocacy Coalition Framework
- how do stakeholders converge into coalitions to advance policy?
- describes policy formation in **subsystems** (substantive policy area/territorially defined policy system)

#### Policy Diffusion model
- how do public policy ideas spread globally?
- provides a more macro-level understanding

#### Institutional Analysis and Design Framework
- action arena: defined rules and allowable actions
- offers a logical basis of making policy related to **common pool resources**
