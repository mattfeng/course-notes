# Week 3: Visions of Governance

## Reading 4. Policy analysis

### Overview
- **policy analysis**. about deciding
    - what government should do and will do
    - how it will do it
    - at what scale to optimize outcomes
    - how it will adapt to new conditions and changing stakeholder interests
- goals of chapter
  - discuss the role of economics in positivist policy analysis
  - discuss Bardach's Eightfold Path in policy analysis
  - discuss tools used in policy analysis

### The positivist approach and economics
- **Auguste Comte**
  - foundational figure in positivist approach used in most public policy analyses
  - **positivism**. everything true can be proven
- **economics**. the study of exchanges of wealth
- **Pareto optimal outcome**. participants in an exchange gain wealth, or at least do not lose wealth
- goods can be **rivalrous** and/or **excludable**
  - rival, excludable: house
    - **private good**
  - nonrival, excludable: canal/toll road
    - **marketable (public) good**
  - rival, nonexcludable: tap water
    - **free goods**
  - nonrival, nonexcludable: air
    - **pure public good**
- **marginal social costs** emerge from the production of _private goods_ that impacts _public goods_ or individual rights

### Policy analysis: the art and science of choices and decisions

- Bardach's Eightfold Path
  1. define the problem
  2. assemble some evidence
  3. construct the alternatives
  4. select the criteria
  5. project outcomes
  6. confront the trade-offs
  7. decide
  8. tell your story
- policy problems often are **market failures** or **preservation of public goods**
- **Delphi method**. anonymous form of consultation of other policy analysts
- costs and benefits given monetary numbers using **monetization**; isn't always appropriate
- criteria
  - efficiency
  - cost-benefit analysis
  - productivity
  - equity
  - social justice
  - legality

#### Tools for policy analysis
- **archival analysis**
  - includes comparative case policy analysis
- personal interviews
- client interviews
- **cost benefit analysis**
  - costs often assigned monetary value
    - labor and supply costs
    - hidden costs (prior experience)
    - opportunity costs
  - benefits harder to quantify
- **demography and policy analysis**
  - changing nature of society's needs must be monitored
- **public opinion surveys**
- **decision theory**
  - consider probabilities of events occuring
- **experimentation**
  - more useful to study outcomes of policy on a large scale in a multitude of settings

### Outcomes of public policy analysis
- modern liberal societies: more expansive role for government
  - protect individual rights
  - promote social, political, and economic equality

## Lecture 4. Rousseau and values
- Agenda
  - Rousseau
  - Values
  - Our values

### Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)
- A wanderer; variety of professions
  - Servant
  - Tutor
  - Musician
  - Writer
  - Notary
  - Clerk
  - Research assistant
  - Fiction author
- Mother dies giving birth to him
- Father abandons him
- After serving the elite, he states:
  - "I hate the great, I hate their high status, their harshness, their pettiness, and all their vices..."
- A man of many contradictions
  - Abandoned all of his five children
  - Many affairs
- Progress is a bad thing because it is morally corrupting
  - Inequality is the root of all evil
  - Progress requires inequality
  - We believe that all should be equal before the law, but _inequalities of wealth are essential in a competitive, free-market economy_ (<T tag="comment" /> no?)
- **veil of ignorance**. moral reasoning device design to promote impartial decision making _by denying decision makers access to potentially biasing information_ about who will benefit most/least from the available options.
- **True self-fulfillment depends on losing yourself in something bigger than yourself.**
- A _joining in process_ where we put our differences aside and come together to make decisions.
- **Asserts the rights of all citizens.**
  - The government serves the people.
  - The "General Will" is always good.
- The right of the sovereign to govern the people

## Lecture 5. Learning theories and learning environments

### Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)
- loses mother and father at early age
- Kant the professor
  - lively lectures
  - rigid in his ways: dress, meals, exercise
  - loved to have company at his home
  - never married, no children
- Kant's ideas
  - Dismisses ideas of **natural rights**
  - Tries to understand: what is knowledge and what is reason?
  - Question: What are objects and how can we knowledge them?
  - Question: How do we come to know something?
  - Question: What is our principal source of knowledge? Is it experience? Is it logic or reason?
  - Question: What is reason?
  - **Rationalism** grounds all knowledge in reason
    - Leibniz
  - **Empiricism**. traces all knowledge to experience; everything is subjective; we cannot know anything because it is tainted by human perspective (Kant is _not_ an empiric)
    - Hume
  - Kant tries to blend both
    - Some truthes are universal, known outside of experience
    - Some truthes are known because of experience
  - Kant: **Universalism**
    - The source of authority in human affairs is _reason_
    - There is a single, universal human nature to which appeal should be made when examining the legitimacy of authority
    - The benefits and burdens of political order lie equally on everyone
    - "What's good for you should be good for me."
  - Not for direct democracy
  - The check on my freedom is your freedom (your rights).
  - Wars result when individual self-interest overrides the requirements of justice.
    - War is _unreasonable_.
  - Key ideas
    - Contrast 1 (Morality). Duty vs. inclination.
    - Contrast 2 (Freedom). Autonomy vs. heteronomy.
    - Contrast 3 (Reason). Categorical vs. hypothetical imperatives.
      - **categorical imperative**. an unconditional moral obligation which is binding in all circumstances and is not dependent on a person's inclination or purpose.
    - Contrast 4 (Standpoints). Intelligible realm (reason, thought) vs. sensible realm (empiricism).
