# Week 3: Visions of Governance

## 4. Policy analysis

### Overview
- **policy analysis**. about deciding
    - what government should do and will do
    - how it will do it
    - at what scale to optimize outcomes
    - how it will adapt to new conditions and changing stakeholder interests
- goals of chapter
  - discuss the role of economics in positivist policy analysis
  - discuss Bardach's Eightfold Path in policy analysis
  - discuss tools used in policy analysis

### The positivist approach and economics
- **Auguste Comte**
  - foundational figure in positivist approach used in most public policy analyses
  - **positivism**. everything true can be proven
- **economics**. the study of exchanges of wealth
- **Pareto optimal outcome**. participants in an exchange gain wealth, or at least do not lose wealth
- goods can be **rivalrous** and/or **excludable**
  - rival, excludable: house
    - **private good**
  - nonrival, excludable: canal/toll road
    - **marketable (public) good**
  - rival, nonexcludable: tap water
    - **free goods**
  - nonrival, nonexcludable: air
    - **pure public good**
- **marginal social costs** emerge from the production of _private goods_ that impacts _public goods_ or individual rights

### Policy analysis: the art and science of choices and decisions

- Bardach's Eightfold Path
  1. define the problem
  2. assemble some evidence
  3. construct the alternatives
  4. select the criteria
  5. project outcomes
  6. confront the trade-offs
  7. decide
  8. tell your story
- policy problems often are **market failures** or **preservation of public goods**
- **Delphi method**. anonymous form of consultation of other policy analysts
- costs and benefits given monetary numbers using **monetization**; isn't always appropriate
- criteria
  - efficiency
  - cost-benefit analysis
  - productivity
  - equity
  - social justice
  - legality

#### Tools for policy analysis
- **archival analysis**
  - includes comparative case policy analysis
- personal interviews
- client interviews
- **cost benefit analysis**
  - costs often assigned monetary value
    - labor and supply costs
    - hidden costs (prior experience)
    - opportunity costs
  - benefits harder to quantify
- **demography and policy analysis**
  - changing nature of society's needs must be monitored
- **public opinion surveys**
- **decision theory**
  - consider probabilities of events occuring
- **experimentation**
  - more useful to study outcomes of policy on a large scale in a multitude of settings

### Outcomes of public policy analysis
- modern liberal societies: more expansive role for government
  - protect individual rights
  - promote social, political, and economic equality
