# Week 2: Visions of Governance

## Readings

### 2.<SPACE /> Thinking about public policy: how choices are made
- scientific study of public policy can help us
  - predict the likely roadblocks to policy adoption
  - achievement of fully effective policy outcomes
  - long-term impacts of policies

#### Institutional analysis and development (IAD)
- by **Elinor Ostrom**
- built around the notion that **distant governments and regulations do not always adequately address policy problems at the local level**
- useful for **common pool resource allocation and use**
- examines the impacts of **institutional arrangements on human behavior**
- **institution**. the shared concepts used by humans in repetitive situations organized by
  - **rules**. mutually understood and enforced by governing agents
  - **norms**. enforced by participants themselves
  - **strategies**. regularized plans that individuals make within the structure of incentives produced by rules, norms, and expectations of likely behavior of others
- **IAD process** is evaluated along six dimensions
  1. economic efficency
    - benefits outweigh transaction costs
  2. fiscal equivalence
    - sharing costs/benefits equally
  3. redistributional equity
  4. accoountablility
  5. conformance to general morality
  6. adaptability
- **IAD assumptions**
  - stakeholders are honest brokers

#### Multiple streams (MS)
- attributed to **John Kingdon**
- key point: policymaking is surrounded by **ambiguity** in problem statements
- three streams in the policy process that must converge for policy to be made
  1. problems stream
  2. policy stream
  3. politics stream
- **problems stream**
  - problem definition should not be ambiguous
- **politics stream**
  - composed of national mood, pressure group campaigns, and administrative or legislative turnver
- convergence of three streams creates a **policy window**

#### Advocacy coalition framework
- attempt to replace _policy stages model_ (introducedl later in the book)
- addresses the **role of technical information** in policymaking
- variables involved
  - **relatively stable parameters**
  - **external factors/events**
- policies advocated by **policy brokers**
- examines how **policy brokers** evolve and maintain/gain power

#### Punctuated equilibrium
- seeks to explain **rapid change in policy areas**
- measure change through studying **public agency budgets**
- punctuated due to limited human attention
- punctuations are rare events

#### Policy diffusion
- **policy innovation**. the act of identifying new policy solutions and adopting them
- state and local policy serve as **laboratories of democracy**
- local communities compete for resources such as **human capital**
- example: _legalization of marijuana_
- example: state-level renewable energy portfolio standards
  - national level has gridlock; states can set own priorities for how much energy comes from renewables

#### Constructivist approach
- argue that the **capacity to process all information needed to make good decision is limited**
- four **narrative categories** shape who deserves policy prioritization
  - advantaged
    - have power, are deserving
  - contender
    - have power, not deserving
  - dependent
    - lack power, are deserving
  - deviant
    - lack power, not deserving
- constructivist approach itself does not offer tools for creating policy

#### Narrative policy framework (NPF)
- builds a story as basis for policy
- occurs on three levels: micro, meso, macro
  - micro
    - focus on the individual
  - meso
    - coalitions of people
  - macro
    - policy narrative constructed by public agencies and laws
- approaches within NPF: structuralist and post-structuralist
  - structuralist
    - adopts parts of **positivist** approach to research: quantitative scientific approaches to study involving theories, quantitative measurement, and testable hypotheses; all verifiable and replicable
  - post-structuralist
    - less reliant on existing texts; can be anecdotal
- **culture theory**
  - two dimensions
    1. decision making by elite decision makers vs. broad-based choices
    2. problems are individual or group concerns
  - four categories
    - fatalist: doesn't matter what I do or think (elite, group)
    - hierarch: there is a defined purpose and place for all things (elite, indiv)
    - individualist: I decide what is right or wrong for me (broad, indiv)
    - egalitarian: we decide what is good for all of us (broad, group)
  - helps explain why certain actors are _villians, heroes, or victims_

#### Process model
- a traditional model of understanding public policy

### 3.<SPACE />Federalism and Intergovernmental Relations
- **federalism**. describes the relationship between two or more levels of government within a nation-state, where each level of government has leaders, independently chosen.
- overview
  - discuss the benefits of federalism in the policy process
  - outline the Founder's vision for federalis
  - discuss contemporary models of federalism
  - discuss intergovernmental relations and policymaking

#### Arguments in favor of federalism
1. more units of government $\to$ citizens have more opportunities to influence policy decisions
2. competition between units of government encourages government efficiency
    - state and local governments compete for citizen taxpayers, offering better benefits per tax dollar
3. federalism can limit the growth of government
4. governments skee efficient and effective responses to citizen demand
5. the competitive nature of federalism fosters economic growth
6. federalism encourages policy innovation

- federalism lies between
  - **unitary government**. all power is retained by central government, local governments execute policy
  - **confederal government**. power resides at the local level and central government is fairly weak
- **Alexander Hamilton** believed that tyranny was more likely to emerge from a weak central government than a strong one
- Founder's conception of federalism
  - the separation of powers within the national and state levels of government
  - the clear delineation of powers for the national government
  - the reduction of centralizing tendencies based on historical evidence
  - the assurance of basic rights to the citizens at the national and state level

#### Dual federalism model
- **dual federalism**. two systems fulfilling distinct purposes without any significant overlap in function
- issues apparent during **Progressive Era (1896â€“1916)** and **Great Depression**

#### Cooperative federalism
- **Cooperative federalism**. the marble cake model of federalism: shared policy goals exist at all levels of government
- characterized much of the New Deal era
- national government helped local and state governments produce and protect basic public goods

#### Nation-centered federalism (NCF)
- **nation-centered federalism**. employs **top-down policymaking** strategies
- Great Society programs, Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action
- NCF focused on issues of
  - chronic poverty
  - educational opportunity
  - employment issues
  - social advancement
- local governments may ignore marginal social costs to trim expenses
- critics say NCF violates **original intent**

#### Clintonian federalism and beyond
- **Clinton focused greater attention on what government does or does not do; less attention on what government ought or ought not to do.**
- policy goals drove the federalism process, rather than the other way around
- **devolution**. the transfer of power from national to state level
- **laboratories of democracy**. policies are tested at the state and local levels
  - example: Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for emissions trading
  - can avoid national-level political gridlock
- focused on empirical reality rather than normative issues
- **Rehnquist Court (1986-2005)**. state checks on national power
- historical evidence indicates that states policy behavior _tends_ to be thoughtful and considered rather than focused solely on an economic bottom line
  - can also be manipulated by **ideologues** (e.g. Florida) <T tag="NB" />
- federalisms is now a **public-private hybrid** among **multiple levels** of government 

#### Intergovernmental relations (IGR)
- policy theorists **Carl Van Horn** and **Donald Van Meter**
  - two major components in intergoevrnmental policy implementation
    1. **policy resources**
        - money
        - professionalism (knowledge, skills, abilities of implementing agency personnel)
          - 70% agency's budget is spent on salaries and benefits
        - **agency culture**. norms and informal rules that shape day-to-day decision-making in an organization
          - affects the **disposition of implementers**: **conservers** to **advocates**
        - **socioeconomic and political conditions**
        - **political culture** (regional norms): three types
          - individualistic. regional government wants to retain power; classical liberalism
          - moralistic. generally **horizontal societies**
          - traditionalistic. resist intergovernmental relationships; generally **vertical societies**
    2. **policy standards**
        - a uniform way of evaluating policy performance
        - methods of enforcing policy
          - **carrots**
            - norms
            - incentives
          - **sticks**
            - loss of incentives
            - sanctions

#### Intergovernmental collaborative policymaking
- involves all stakeholders
- may not be the most effective as it limits the value of differences

#### Fiscal federalism
- **fiscal federalism**. the use of grants and revenue sharing by national government to shape the policy choices of state and local government.
- grants
  - **categorical grants**
  - **formula grants**
  - **project grants**
  - **block grants**
- mandates
  - **funded mandate**
  - **unfunded mandate**

## Lecture 2.

### Who was Adam Smith? (1723-1790)
- rural Scotland on the East Coast
- Father, well-to-do, died before Smith was born
- Mother was from a prominent family

- Kidnapped by vagrants when he was 3 years old
  - Trauma $\to$ colic?
- Saved by an uncle
- Attended university in Glasgow, Scotland at 14
  - **leaving home at a young age is life-changing**
  - Key time to be in Glasgow: time of enlightment, bustling city with **trade**
  - Moves from rural to city
- Studies in Oxford for 6 years (miserable with teaching style at Oxford)
  - Professors just present problem at beginning of semester; students need to learn on their own
- Becomes a teacher at Glasgow
- Publishes **Theory of Moral Sentiments**
- Takes 10 years to write **The Wealth of Nations**
  - How do countries create **wealth**?
- **Pin factory**
  - Smith notices the value of the **division of labor**
- Ideas
  - Individuals are rational self-maximizers, pursuing their individual good in private realm of marketplace and public sphere of government
  - **Invisible hand**
    - the unobservable market force that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market reach equilibrium automatically
  - Equilibrium
  - Markets provide what is needed
- **Assumes** everyone has their own free choice
- Every focuses on their own self interest; people don't make decisions "to serve the public good" (can't trust people who say that)
- **When the regulation, is in support of the workmen, it is always just and equitable**
  - But it is sometimes otherwise when in favor of the masters
  - Adam Smith likes the **laborers**
- **No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the few greater part of the members are poor and miserable**
- On taxes
  - It is not unreasonable that the **rich should contribute to the public experience**, not only in proportion to their revenue, **but something more than in proportion**
- On the education of the poor
  - But though the common people cannot, in any civilized society, be so well instructed as people of some rank and future
    - Not every is equal
  - People need to know how to **read, write, and account**
  - Society should pay for education of the poor
  - The teacher should **not be wholly paid by the public, because if wholly paid by public he would neglect it**

## Lecture 3. John Stuart Mill

### John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)
- Examines the _human condition_.
- child prodigy
- was kept away from other children, except his siblings
- greatly respected father
- tutored by his father
- tutored by **Benthem** on **Utilitarianism**
  - **do no harm**
- eldest sibling

#### Mill's Dark Night of the Soul
- suppose that all of your objects in life were realized: would this be a great joy and happiness to you?
  - Utilitarianism: no!
- there is pleasure and meaning in activity and in struggling to achieve one's goals.
- Examines what is **happiness**: **Happiness principle** (don't harm others)

#### Relationships
- Life changing relationship with Harriet Taylor
  - Harriet Taylor was married with 3 kids (another man named John Taylor)

#### Equality and freedom
- Are we all born equal?
  - No, equality is a real concern, **we are not naturally equal**.
- When freedom limits the potential, the opportunities for a person to grow and develop (e.g. access to education), government has a role.

#### Freedom of speech
- Don't censor, no matter how false they are
