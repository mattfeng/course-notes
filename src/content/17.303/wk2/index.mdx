# Week 2: Visions of Governance

## Readings

### 2.<SPACE /> Thinking about public policy: how choices are made
- scientific study of public policy can help us
  - predict the likely roadblocks to policy adoption
  - achievement of fully effective policy outcomes
  - long-term impacts of policies

#### Institutional analysis and development (IAD)
- by **Elinor Ostrom**
- built around the notion that **distant governments and regulations do not always adequately address policy problems at the local level**
- useful for **common pool resource allocation and use**
- examines the impacts of **institutional arrangements on human behavior**
- **institution**. the shared concepts used by humans in repetitive situations organized by
  - **rules**. mutually understood and enforced by governing agents
  - **norms**. enforced by participants themselves
  - **strategies**. regularized plans that individuals make within the structure of incentives produced by rules, norms, and expectations of likely behavior of others
- **IAD process** is evaluated along six dimensions
  1. economic efficency
    - benefits outweigh transaction costs
  2. fiscal equivalence
    - sharing costs/benefits equally
  3. redistributional equity
  4. accoountablility
  5. conformance to general morality
  6. adaptability
- **IAD assumptions**
  - stakeholders are honest brokers

#### Multiple streams (MS)
- attributed to **John Kingdon**
- key point: policymaking is surrounded by **ambiguity** in problem statements
- three streams in the policy process that must converge for policy to be made
  1. problems stream
  2. policy stream
  3. politics stream
- **problems stream**
  - problem definition should not be ambiguous
- **politics stream**
  - composed of national mood, pressure group campaigns, and administrative or legislative turnver
- convergence of three streams creates a **policy window**

#### Advocacy coalition framework
- attempt to replace _policy stages model_ (introducedl later in the book)
- addresses the **role of technical information** in policymaking
- variables involved
  - **relatively stable parameters**
  - **external factors/events**
- policies advocated by **policy brokers**
- examines how **policy brokers** evolve and maintain/gain power

#### Punctuated equilibrium
- seeks to explain **rapid change in policy areas**
- measure change through studying **public agency budgets**
- punctuated due to limited human attention
- punctuations are rare events

#### Policy diffusion
- **policy innovation**. the act of identifying new policy solutions and adopting them
- state and local policy serve as **laboratories of democracy**
- local communities compete for resources such as **human capital**
- example: _legalization of marijuana_
- example: state-level renewable energy portfolio standards
  - national level has gridlock; states can set own priorities for how much energy comes from renewables

#### Constructivist approach
- argue that the **capacity to process all information needed to make good decision is limited**
- four **narrative categories** shape who deserves policy prioritization
  - advantaged
    - have power, are deserving
  - contender
    - have power, not deserving
  - dependent
    - lack power, are deserving
  - deviant
    - lack power, not deserving
- constructivist approach itself does not offer tools for creating policy

#### Narrative policy framework (NPF)
- builds a story as basis for policy
- occurs on three levels: micro, meso, macro
  - micro
    - focus on the individual
  - meso
    - coalitions of people
  - macro
    - policy narrative constructed by public agencies and laws
- approaches within NPF: structuralist and post-structuralist
  - structuralist
    - adopts parts of **positivist** approach to research: quantitative scientific approaches to study involving theories, quantitative measurement, and testable hypotheses; all verifiable and replicable
  - post-structuralist
    - less reliant on existing texts; can be anecdotal
- **culture theory**
  - two dimensions
    1. decision making by elite decision makers vs. broad-based choices
    2. problems are individual or group concerns
  - four categories
    - fatalist: doesn't matter what I do or think (elite, group)
    - hierarch: there is a defined purpose and place for all things (elite, indiv)
    - individualist: I decide what is right or wrong for me (broad, indiv)
    - egalitarian: we decide what is good for all of us (broad, group)
  - helps explain why certain actors are _villians, heroes, or victims_

#### Process model
- a traditional model of understanding public policy

## Lecture 2.

### Who was Adam Smith? (1723-1790)
- rural Scotland on the East Coast
- Father, well-to-do, died before Smith was born
- Mother was from a prominent family

- Kidnapped by vagrants when he was 3 years old
  - Trauma $\to$ colic?
- Saved by an uncle
- Attended university in Glasgow, Scotland at 14
  - **leaving home at a young age is life-changing**
  - Key time to be in Glasgow: time of enlightment, bustling city with **trade**
  - Moves from rural to city
- Studies in Oxford for 6 years (miserable with teaching style at Oxford)
  - Professors just present problem at beginning of semester; students need to learn on their own
- Becomes a teacher at Glasgow
- Publishes **Theory of Moral Sentiments**
- Takes 10 years to write **The Wealth of Nations**
  - How do countries create **wealth**?
- **Pin factory**
  - Smith notices the value of the **division of labor**
- Ideas
  - Individuals are rational self-maximizers, pursuing their individual good in private realm of marketplace and public sphere of government
  - **Invisible hand**
    - the unobservable market force that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market reach equilibrium automatically
  - Equilibrium
  - Markets provide what is needed
- **Assumes** everyone has their own free choice
- Every focuses on their own self interest; people don't make decisions "to serve the public good" (can't trust people who say that)
- **When the regulation, is in support of the workmen, it is always just and equitable**
  - But it is sometimes otherwise when in favor of the masters
  - Adam Smith likes the **laborers**
- **No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the few greater part of the members are poor and miserable**
- On taxes
  - It is not unreasonable that the **rich should contribute to the public experience**, not only in proportion to their revenue, **but something more than in proportion**
- On the education of the poor
  - But though the common people cannot, in any civilized society, be so well instructed as people of some rank and future
    - Not every is equal
  - People need to know how to **read, write, and account**
  - Society should pay for education of the poor
  - The teacher should **not be wholly paid by the public, because if wholly paid by public he would neglect it**
