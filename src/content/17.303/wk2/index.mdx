# Week 2: Visions of Governance

## Readings

### 2.<SPACE /> Thinking about public policy: how choices are made
- scientific study of public policy can help us
  - predict the likely roadblocks to policy adoption
  - achievement of fully effective policy outcomes
  - long-term impacts of policies

#### Institutional analysis and development (IAD)
- by **Elinor Ostrom**
- built around the notion that **distant governments and regulations do not always adequately address policy problems at the local level**
- examines the impacts of **institutional arrangements on human behavior**
- **institution**. the shared concepts used by humans in repetitive situations organized by
  - **rules**. mutually understood and enforced by governing agents
  - **norms**. enforced by participants themselves
  - **strategies**. regularized plans that individuals make within the structure of incentives produced by rules, norms, and expectations of likely behavior of others
- **IAD process** is evaluated along six dimensions
  1. economic efficency
    - benefits outweigh transaction costs
  2. fiscal equivalence
    - sharing costs/benefits equally
  3. redistributional equity
  4. accoountablility
  5. conformance to general morality
  6. adaptability
- **IAD assumptions**
  - stakeholders are honest brokers

#### Multiple streams (MS)
- attributed to **John Kingdon**
- key point: policymaking is surrounded by **ambiguity** in problem statements
- three streams in the policy process that must converge for policy to be made
  1. problems stream
  2. policy stream
  3. politics stream
- **problems stream**
  - problem definition should not be ambiguous
- **politics stream**
  - composed of national mood, pressure group campaigns, and administrative or legislative turnver
- convergence of three streams creates a **policy window**

#### Advocacy coalition framework
- attempt to replace _policy stages model_ (introducedl later in the book)
- addresses the **role of technical information** in policymaking
- variables involved
  - **relatively stable parameters**
  - **external factors/events**
- policies advocated by **policy brokers**
- examines how **policy brokers** evolve and maintain/gain power

#### Punctuated equilibrium
- seeks to explain **rapid change in policy areas**
- measure change through studying **public agency budgets**
- punctuated due to limited human attention
- punctuations are rare events

#### Policy diffusion
- **policy innovation**. the act of identifying new policy solutions and adopting them
- state and local policy serve as **laboratories of democracy**
- local communities compete for resources such as **human capital**
- example: _legalization of marijuana_
- example: state-level renewable energy portfolio standards
  - national level has gridlock; states can set own priorities for how much energy comes from renewables

#### Constructivist approach

#### Narrative policy framework (NPF)

#### Process model
- a traditional model of understanding public policy
