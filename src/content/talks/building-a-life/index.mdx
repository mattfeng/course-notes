# Building a life

## Domains of success
- the four domains
  - achievement
  - significance
    - who do you care about and how?
  - happiness
  - legacy
- the four domains are uncorrelated

## Difficulties of maximizing all axes
- when do you move on?
- cannot do one thing at a time (life is parallel)

## How to handle all four domains
- **juggling**, not balance
  - need to keep eye on all four
  - need to give each energy

## Successful people
- Had a reasonable sense of **enough**
  - "enough" allows for considering the **excess**
  - "enough" allows you to move on
    - setting limits allows for succeeding further on each of the domains

## Questions
- Is this an inflection point?
  - Is this inflection point giving you more freedom?
- Is the juice worth the squeeze?
  - Am I headed in the right direction?
- Are you cheating at solitaire?
- Culture: Am I in the right place?

## Rules
- Live life forward.
- Find an individual board of directors (often only a mentor in a subset of life).
  - Can't handle more than 6 or 7.
- Life is risky. Some things are uncontrollable.
- Plan for the ripple, not the splash.

## Test
- Who are you?
  - What are your values?
- What domains to satisfaction are you missing?
- Who is important to you and how are you helping them?
- What's your time frame for action?
