# Koch Institute `with/in/sight` Speaker Series

## How are cancer researchers fighting COVID-19? (March 29, 2022)

### Angela Belcher, _Novel materials for PPE_
- Dr. Jifa Qi
- developing highly absorbant materials with viruses to kill viruses
- BioCNFs (biologically-templated carbon nanofibers): high microporosity: 2000 m^2/g
- tested **breakthrough filtration** using m2 viruses
- quaternary ammonium compounds ("quats") in disinfectant wipes
- working on PFOA and PFBS

### Hojun Li, MD, PhD, _On-demand protective immunity testing_
- adaptive immunity
  - cellular: T cells $\to$ killer cells
  - humoral: B cells $\to$ antibodies
- neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are key
  - prevents SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells
  - assays to measure antibodies is expensive and time consuming
- vulnerable populations **need to rely on their humoral adaptive immune system**
- nAbs block the spike:ACE2 interaction
- simple LFA: qualitative
  - RBD mixed with drop of blood
  - fix ACE2 to paper
  - RBD with no nAb will bind
  - RBD with nAb will bind
- want to **quantify**
  - normalize based on neutralizing line
- test even outperforms ELISA at low titers
- use cases
  - serial monitoring for vaccine booster timing, particular for vulnerable populations
  - defining true protective titers in population-scale studies

### Michael Yaffe, _Overcoming respiratory distress_
- respiratory failure
  - not enough ventilators
  - unique pneumonia: rapid deterioration
    - different from typical ARDS
    - _low pressure_ respiratory failure, rather than typical high-pressure
  - COVID-19 causes heart attacks and strokes
- later in the pandemic, realize that COVID-19 causes _blood clots_
- tumors often cause inflammation that causes _blood clots_: **immunothrombosis**
- tPA treatment is effective
  - works best in actively deteriorating respiratory distress

### Pivoting back to regular research
- shift in mindset toward practical applications
- increase cross-talk within lab (work on _inflammation_)
