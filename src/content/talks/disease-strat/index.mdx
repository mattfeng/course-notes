## Notes
- Multilayer networks
  - more complicated heterogenous multilayer networks
  - representation pioneered by **Anais Baudot**
- participation coefficient measures the importance of a node in the multilayer network
- Random walk with restarts (RWR) to build **affinity scores**
  - use Python package `multiXrank`
- layers:
  - protein interactions
  - treatments
  - genetic mutations/pathways/metabolism
- use cases
  - congenital myasthenic syndrome
    - biological knowledge
      - metabolome
      - interactome
      - reactome
    - clinical data
      - compound heterozygous variants
      - copy number variants
      - known CMS genes
  - medulloblastoma (MB)
    - biological data
      - protein interactions
      - drug targets
      - genetic varints
      - pathways
      - metabolic reactions
    - medical data
      - proteogenomic data (~14,000 altered genes per patient)
    - goal: reduce the **set of genes** to find actionable interventions
      - result: **1,800 altered genes** (10x reduction)
  - hepatoblastoma (hB)
    - underlying biology is largely unknown
    - layers
      - Reactome
      - IDD (UToronto)
      - BIGG models (UCSD)
