# designing proteins

- we can construct proteins that have a particular fold
- _but how do we know what fold we need, e.g. to perform a catalysis?_
- M-CSA database (first release: 2017)
    - only 1003 entries
    - 760 have detailed mechanism, others only have catalytic site
- MACiE was the original catalytic mechanism database
    - Metal MACiE supplemented MACiE by including catalytic metal ion mechanisms
