# enzyme mechanisms

- to fully know a mechanism, need to know
    - actors
        - substrates
        - cofactors
        - products
        - regulators
    - temporal sequence enzyme-bound intermediates form
    - structure of intermediates and transition states
    - rates of interconversion between intermediates
    - structural relationship of the enzyme to each intermediate
    - energy contributed by all interacting groups to intermediate complexes and transition states
