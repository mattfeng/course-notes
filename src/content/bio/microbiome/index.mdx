# microbiome

- related diseases
    - ulcerative colitis (UC)
    - Crohn's disease (CD)
    - inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

- there exist microbiome-reactive T cells that may be the cause of various diseases
- Lithocholic acid (LCA) regulate differentiation of naive T cells into Treg and Th17 cells
- SCFAs promote mucus and antimicrobial peptides production (SCFAs good)
- early life colonization by _immune-silencing microbiota_ may hinder immune education and enhance susceptibility to immune disease
- IBD can potentially teach us about autoimmune diseases in general
- microbiome and cancer: microbiome influences
    - cancer onset
    - progression
    - response to therapy
- related projects
    - Integrative Human Microbiome Project

- next steps
    - resolve the human metabolome into
        - host
        - microbial
        - co- metabolites (those initially derived from the host and modified by microbes, or vice versa)
    - build chemical libraries that can be tested in functional assays
    - create a complete annotation of the
        - microbes
        - genes
        - proteins
        - metabolites
        within the human microbiome for hypothesis-based functional studies that reveal biological mechanisms at work in disease
- challenges
    - need to study immunomodulatory molecules and other bioactives derived from microbes at physiological concentrations
    - develop deep mechanistic understandings with particular emphasis on potential pleiotropic effects
        - a single microbial metabolite may bind multiple host receptors, each with a distinct, often cell type-specific biological outcome
        - stimulation thresholds determined by signal strength, duration, or both might also dictate host responses
        - Synergistic or antagonistic effects that are not observed in reductionist models could appear in more complex contexts and emphasize the critical importance of conducting functional studies in simple systems, such as mono- and co-cultures, as well as sophisticated models that more closely resemble tissues
    - consider pharmacokinetic processes of administration, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion when evaluating metabolites or microbes themselves as therapeutics
