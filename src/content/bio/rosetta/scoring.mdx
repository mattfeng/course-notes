# the rosetta scoring function (evaluating energy)

- the scoring function computes the energy of a system
- previous scoring functions
    - SCORE12
    - Talaris13
    - Talaris14
    - REF2015
        - finally compatible with kcal/mol, rather than REU
- two types of scoring functions: (1) **low resolution** and (2) **high resolution**
    - **low resolution**
        - good for global search of conformational space


- **energy terms.** the terms that make up the total energy of a system
    - two kinds: (1) physics-based and (2) knowledge-based, i.e. experimental data
    - **physics-based**
        - `fa_atr`. attractive energy between two atoms on _different residues_ (Lennard-Jones potential VDW)
        - `fa_rep`. repulsive energy between two atoms on _different residues_ (LJ potential VDW)
        - `fa_rep_intra`. repulsive energy between two atoms on _the same residue_
