- $\int \psi^{\star}\psi d \tau$
    - $d \tau$ is the appropriate volume element <T tag="atkins/248" />
- **coulomb's law.** $F = \dfrac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$
    - $q_i$ is charge
    - $\epsilon_0$ is permitivity of free space
    - $r$ is distance between the particles
- $j_0 = \dfrac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$
    - repulsive force between two electrons: $\dfrac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2} = \dfrac{j_0}{r^2}$
    - repulsive PE between two electrons: $\dfrac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r} = \dfrac{j_0}{r}$
        - $r$ is distance between electrons
- $r_{A1}$ is distance to nucleus A
- $r_{B1}$ is distance to nucleus B
- $R$ is bond length (distance between two nuclei)
- $j$
- $k$


## questions
- question: why does mixing orbitals create one of more stable energy? what's the math?
