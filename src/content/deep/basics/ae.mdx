# autoencoders

autoencoders are _unsupervised neural networks_ used to learn efficient _codings (a.k.a. **embeddings**)_ of unlabeled data (this process is otherwise known as **representation learning**).

## variational autoencoders

- $P_{gt}$ is the probability of the _ground truth_.
- **goal:** learn a model $P$ that we can sample from, such that $P$ is as similar to $P_{gt}$ as possible
