# AlphaFold 2 (AF2)

## how to use
- inputs
    - multiple sequence alignment (MSA) should contain _at least 30 sequences_
    - an MSA of _100 sequences_ is generally good enough to use without templates
- caveats
    - uncertain domain placement
        - AF2 is unaware of membranes; membrane proteins won't leave space for the cell membrane
        - clashes can occur
    - complexes
        - AF2 is trained to only predict single chain protein structures
            - heteromers are more problematic 
        - some have success predicting complexes by joining two sequences with a _linker_
            - ideas in AF2 can definitely be extended to complexes
            - needs to be benchmarked


## measures of uncertainty
- **predicted local distance difference test (pLDDT).** alphafold's per-residue prediction of its lDDT-CÎ±; provides a measure of _local confidence_
    - closely related to [lDDT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799472/). measures the percentage of correctly predicted interatomic distances
    - ranges from _0 to 100_
    - prediction files contain the pLDDT in the _B-factors_ (higher is better, which is opposite of typical B-factors)
    - low pLDDT (pLDDT < 50): _a prediction of disorder_
- **predicted aligned error (PAE).** alphafold's prediction of its position error at residue $X$, if the predicted and true structures were aligned on residue $Y$.
