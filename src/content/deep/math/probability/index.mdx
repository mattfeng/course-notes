## Expectations

- **LOCUS (Law of the Unconscious Statistician).**
    - also known as: **Law of the Lazy Statistician**

### Conditional expectation

- **Definition of conditional expectation (DCE).**
    - $$\E{X}{X | Y = y} = f(y) = hi$$
    - $$\E{X}{X|Y}$$ is the random variable corresponding to when we don't know the value of $Y$, i.e. $f(Y)$
- **Rule of Iterated Expectations (RIE).**
    - $$\E{X,Y}{f(X, Y)} = \E{X}{\E{Y|X}{f(X, Y) | X}}$$
