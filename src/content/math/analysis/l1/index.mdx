# Lecture 1. Constructing the Rational Numbers

> "God created the integers; all else is the work of man." &mdash; Kronecker

- Kronecker was a finitist: mathematics should only deal with objects obtained from finite numbers in a finite number of operations.
    - Opposed the use of irrational numbers
    - Doubted the significance of non-constructive existence proofs
- **There are lots of things we take for granted that weren't always so _obvious_.** Real analysis is about examining some of those "obvious" things.

## Analysis: wrestling with the infinite
- What does it mean for a series of numbers to converge?
- What is a limit?
- Are there "enough" numbers to capture all limits?
- History
    - late 1600s: **Newton, Leibniz**
    - early 1800s: Fourier series made **Laplace, Lagrange** uneasy
    - 1820: **Cauchy**
    - 1850s &ndash; 1860s: **Weierstrass, Riemann**

## Notation

### Sets and relations
- A **set** is a collection of objects.
    - Denoted $S$.
    - e.g. $S = \{1, \bigcirc, \{3, 4\}\}$.
    - e.g. $S = \{x : P(x) = \mathrm{true}\}$.

### Set operations
- **Union**
- **Intersection**
- **Difference**
- **Product**
    - $A \times B = \{ (a, b) : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$

### Relations
- A **(binary) relation** $R$ is a subset of $\p{A}{B}$.
    - If $(a, b) \in R$, write $\rel{a}{b}$.
    - e.g. $A = \text{"is an ancestor of"}$ is a relation on $\p{P}{P}$ ($P$ is the set of people).
- An **equivalence relation** $R$ on a set $S$ is a relation on $\p{S}{S}$ such that:
    1. **reflexivity.** $\rel{a}{a}$
    2. **symmetry.** $\rel{a}{b} \implies \rel{b}{a}$
    3. **transitivity.** $\rel{a}{b} \and \rel{b}{c} \implies \rel{a}{c}$
    - Used to denote that objects are "same" in some sense, e.g. $=$, "all the sophomores"
- _Aside_: A **function** $F$ from $A$ to $B$ is a relation such that if $\rel{a}{b}$ and $\rel{a}{b'}$ then $b = b'$.

## Construction of $\Q$

- Assume we know $\Z$, their _arithmetic_, and their _order_.
- Trick: Think of $\Q$ has ordered pairs of $\Z$.
- What is $\Q$? Perhaps $\Q = \left\{\dfrac{m}{n} : m, n \in \Z, n \neq 0 \right\}$.
    - But we don't know what $\frac{m}{n}$ means!
- Motivation: $\frac{1}{3}$ means "1 part of 3".
    - But it's the same as "2 parts of 6".
- We need to define an _equivalence relation_.
- $\Q$ is **the set of all equivalence classes** of $\p{\Z}{(\Z \setminus \{0\})}$ following the equivalence relation:
    - $(p, q) \sim (m, n) \ifft pn = qm$.
    - $\Q$ extends $\Z$, so that $\frac{n}{1} \in \Q$ corresponds (isomorphic) to $n \in \Z$.

### Proof that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation
1. reflexive
    - $(p, q) \sim (p, q)$ because $pq = pq$.
2. symmetric
    - $(p, q) \sim (m, n) \implies pn = qm \implies mq = np \implies (m, n) \sim (p, q)$.
3. transitive
    - **cancellation law in $\Z$.** if $ab = ac, a \neq 0$, then $b = c$.
