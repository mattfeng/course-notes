# Lecture 1. Constructing the Rational Numbers

> "God created the integers; all else is the work of man." &mdash; Kronecker

- Kronecker was a finitist: mathematics should only deal with objects obtained from finite numbers in a finite number of operations.
    - Opposed the use of irrational numbers
    - Doubted the significance of non-constructive existence proofs
- **There are lots of things we take for granted that weren't always so _obvious_.**

## Analysis: wrestling with the infinite
- What does it mean for a series of numbers to converge?
- What is a limit?
- Are there "enough" numbers to capture all limits?
- History
    - late 1600s: **Newton, Leibniz**
    - early 1800s: Fourier series made **Laplace, Lagrange** uneasy
    - 1820: **Cauchy**
    - 1850s &ndash; 1860s: **Weierstrass, Riemann**

## Notation

### Sets and relations
- A **set** is a collection of objects.
    - Denoted $S$.
    - e.g. $S = \{1, \bigcirc, \{3, 4\}\}$.
    - e.g. $S = \{x : P(x) = \mathrm{true}\}$.

### Set operations
- product
    - $A \times B = \{ (a, b) : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$

### Relations
- A **(binary) relation** $R$ is a subset of $\p{A}{B}$.
    - If $(a, b) \in R$, write $\rel{a}{b}$.
