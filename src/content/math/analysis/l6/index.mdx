# Lecture 6. The Principle of Induction

**Axiom (well ordering principle of $\N$, WOP).** $\N$ is well-ordered: every non-empty subset of $\N$ has a **least element**.

## Principle of Induction
**Definition (the principle of induction, POI).** Let $S$ be a subset of $\N$ such that

1. $1 \in S$.
2. if $k \in S$, then $k + 1 \in S$.

Then $\boxed{S = \N}$.

<br/>

**Theorem.** WOP $\iff$ POI.

**Proof (WOP $\implies$ POI, by contradiction).** 

- Suppose we have a set $S$ with the properties in POI, but $S \neq \N$.
- Then $A = \N \smallsetminus S$ has a least element $x$ (by the WOP).
- It is not $1$ (by property 1 that $1 \in S$).
- Its predecessor is in $S$ (not in $A$) as it is smaller than the least element in $A$. But that means $x$ is in $S$ by property 2 of POI.
- We have a contradiction: $x \in S$ and $x \in A$.
- Therefore, $S = \N$. $\blacksquare$

### Proofs by induction
Use the POI to prove a collection of statements that are indexed by the natural numbers.

- Let $P(n)$ be statements ordered by $n \in \N$.
- To show that $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \N$, show
    1. **(base case)** $P(1)$ is true. 
    2. **(inductive step)** If $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k + 1)$ is true.
        - Assuming $P(k)$ is true is called the **inductive hypothesis**.

We're showing that the set $S = \{n : P(n)\ \text{is true}\}$ actually is $S = \N$.

### Strong induction
Modify the inductive hypothesis to assume $P(1), P(2), ..., P(k)$ are all true.

### Examples

**(S1) Theorem.**  Every $2^n \times 2^n$ chessboard with one square removed can be tiled by L shaped tiles.

**Proof (by induction).**
- **Base case.** $n = 1$. The $2 \times 2$ chessboard clearly can be tiled.
- **Inductive step.** Divide the $2^{k + 1} \times 2^{k + 1}$ board into four $2^k \times 2^k$ boards. Since any $2^k \times 2^k$ board with one square removed can be tiled, we can specifically remove one tile in a way to leave space for an L shaped tile.

**Note:** start with the $k + 1$ case and find the subproblems $k$. Going the other direction is problematic: We don't know that putting together $k$ subproblems will be general enough for all $k + 1$ cases.

**(E1) Theorem.** Any finite set of numbers contains its supremum.

**Proof (by induction).** Let's induct on the number of elements in $S$.
- **Base case ($|S| = 1$).** Clearly, the supremum is the only element in $S$.
- **Inductive step.** Suppose we have a set $S$ with $k + 1$ elements. Remove any element $a$ from $S$ to form $S' = S \smallsetminus \{a\}$. $S'$ has a supremum $\alpha'$. If $a > \alpha'$, then $a$ is the supremum of $S$. If $a \leq \alpha'$, then $\alpha'$ is the supremum of $S$. $\blacksquare$

**(S2) Theorem.** $S_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n + 1)$ is a perfect square.

**Proof (by induction).** We show a stronger proof, that $S_n = n^2$ (this lets us assume more in the inductive hypothesis).
- **Base case.** Holds since $S_1 = 1 = 1^2$ is a perfect square.
- **Inductive step.** $S_{n + 1} = S_n + 2n + 1 = n^2 + 2n + 1 = (n + 1)^2$. $\blacksquare$
