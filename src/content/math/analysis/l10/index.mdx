# Lecture 10. The Relationship between Open and Closed Sets

## Motivations
- Why do we care about open sets?
  - It means we can perturb points in $E$ and still have them stay in $E$.

## Recall
- A set $E$ in metric space $X$ is **open** if every point is an interior point.
- A set $K$ is **closed** if $K$ contains all its limit points.
- The **closure** of set $A$ is $\bar{A} = A \cup A'$.
  - $A'$ is the set of limit points of $A$.

## Closures

**Lemma.** Neighborhoods are open.

**Proof.** Let $p$ be a point, and $N(p, r)$ be the open ball of radius $r$ around $p$. Let $q$ be any point in $N(p, r)$. Let $a = d(p, q) < r$. Let $r' = r - a$. $N(q, r') \subset N(p, r)$ by the triangle inequality.

**Theorem.** $\bar{A}$ is a closed set.

**Proof.**
- We need to show that if $p$ is a limit point of $\bar{A}$, then $p \in \bar{A}$.
  - This means that we need to show that $p \in A$, or $p$ is a limit point of $A$.
    - That is, if $p$ isn't already in $A$, then any neighborhood around $p$ contains a point in $A$.
- Consider $p$, a limit point of $\bar{A}$.
  - If $p \in A$, then we are done.
  - If $p \not\in A$:
    - Any neighborhood $N(p)$ of $p$ contains a point $q$ of $\bar{A}$.
    - Suppose $q \in A'$ but not $q \in A$.
    - Then any $N(q)$ contains a $q' \in A$.
      - Consider $N(q)$ that is contained entirely in $N(p)$.
        - Such an $N(q)$ must exist because neighborhoods are open, meaning $q$ is an interior point of $N(p)$ (by definition of an open set), which means that it has a neighborhood completely contained in $N(p)$.
      - Then $q' \in N(q) \subset N(p) \implies q' \in N(p)$ which means $p$ is a limit point of $A$ (not just $\bar{A}$). Thus, $p$ is in $A'$ and therefore $\bar{A}$, and we are done. $\blacksquare$

**Theorem.** $E$ closed $\iff$ $E = \bar{E}$.

**Proof.**
- Forward direction
  - $E$ closed $\implies E' \subset E$ so $E \cup E' = \bar{E} \subset E$.
  - $E \subset \bar{E}$ by definition.
  - Thus, $E = \bar{E}$.
- Reverse direction
  - If $E = \bar{E}$, then by definition $E$ contains all its limit points.

**Theorem.** If $E$ is a subset of closed set $F$, then $\bar{E} \subset F$.
- Moral: $\bar{E}$ is the smallest **closed set** containing $E$.

**Proof.**
- $F$ is closed, and thus contains all its limit points.
- If $p$ is a limit point of $E$, then $p$ is a limit point of $F$.
  - Limit points mean that any neighborhood around $p$ contains a point of $E$. Since $F$ is a superset of $E$, any neighborhood must also contain a point of $F$.
- $E$ is a subset of $F$, so $F$ contains all the limit points of $E$. $\blacksquare$

## The relationship between open and closed sets

**Theorem.** In metric space $(X, d)$, $E$ is open iff $E^c$ is closed.
- $E^c$ is the **complement** of $E$, defined to be $E^c = X \setminus E$.

**Proof.**
- Intuitively, if a set has its "boundary," then its complement does not, and vice versa.
- Since we only use definitions, everything in the proof is _bidirectional_.
- $E$ open means any point $x \in E$ is an interior point.
- That means for any $x \in E$, there exists neighborhood $N(x)$ contained entirely in $E$.
- Because $N(x) \subset E$, $N(x)$ is disjoint from $E^c$. Thus $x \in E$ cannot be a limit point of $E^c$.
- If no $x \in E$ is a limit point of $E^c$, then $E^c$ must contain all its limit points. $\blacksquare$

## Properties of open and closed sets

### Unions and intersections

- The union of infinitely many closed sets is not necessarily closed.
  - e.g. $K_a = [-1 + \frac{1}{a}, 1 - \frac{1}{a}]$
    - $\bigcup K_a = (-1, 1)$

**Lemma (DeMorgan's Laws).** Let $\{E_\alpha\}$ be a collection of sets. Then $(\bigcup_\alpha E_\alpha)^c = \bigcap_\alpha E_\alpha^c$.

**Proof.**
- $x \in \text{LHS} \iff x \in E_\alpha^c$ for all $\alpha \in A \iff x \in \text{RHS}$.

**Theorem.**
1. The arbitrary union of open sets is open.
2. The arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed.
3. The finite intersection of open sets is open.
4. The finite union of closed sets is closed.

**Proof.**
1. Let $x \in \bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha$, each $U_\alpha$ is open.
    - For some $U_\alpha$, $x$ has a neighborhood $N(x)$ such that $N(x) \subset U_\alpha \subset \bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha$.
2. The arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed.
    - Suppose $B_\alpha$ are all closed. Then $B_\alpha^c$ are open. Therefore $\bigcup B_\alpha^c = (\bigcap B_\alpha)^c$ is open, and thus $\bigcap B_\alpha$ is closed.
3. The finite intersection of open sets is open.
    - Take the minimum radius neighborhood; the neighborhood thus will be contained in the intersection.
4. The finite union of closed sets is closed.
  - Use DeMorgan's laws.

**Definition (dense).** $E$ is **dense** in metric space $X$ if
- every point of $X$ is a limit point of $E$ or in $E$, or
- $\bar{E} = X$, or
- every open set in $X$ contains a point in $E$
  - $\bar{E}$ means that $\bar{E}$ contains all its limit points, or every neighborhood around any point in $\bar{E}$ has a point in $\bar{E}$.
  - an open set is made up of one or more neighborhoods

**S1.** $\Q$ is dense in $\R$.
**S2.** Essentially, we are asking if we can approximate any point in $X$ with points in $E$.
- e.g. Fourier series: is the set of all linear combinations of sines and cosines dense in the space of all functions?
