# Lecture 12. Relationship of Compact Sets to Closed Sets

#### Recall

- A set $K$ in metric space $(X, d)$ is **compact** if _every open cover_ of $K$ has a _finite subcover_.

**Theorem 1.** Suppose $K \subset Y \subset X$. Then $K$ compact in $Y$ $\iff$ $K$ compact in $X$.
- Moral: Compactness is an _intrinsic_ property of a set.

**Proof.**
- ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $K$ is compact in $Y$. We need to show that for all open covers in of $K$ in $X$, $K$ has a finite subcover in $X$.
    - Consider an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $K$ in $X$.
    - Let $V_\alpha = U_\alpha \cap Y$. Then $\{V_\alpha\}$ cover $K$ in $Y$.
    - By compactness of $K$ in $Y$, there exists a finite subcover $\{V_{\alpha_i}\}$.
    - Then $\{U_{\alpha_i}\}$ is a finite subcover of $K$ in $X$. $\blacksquare$
- ($\Leftarrow$)
    - Consider an open cover $\{V_\alpha\}$ of $K$ in $Y$.
    - By **Theorem L11.1**, there exist $U_\alpha \subset X$ such that $U_\alpha \cap Y = V_\alpha$.
    - $\{U_\alpha\}$ cover $K$ in $X$ and has finite subcover $\{U_{\alpha_i}\}$.
    - Thus $\{V_{\alpha_i}\}$ form a finite subcover of $K$ in $Y$. $\blacksquare$

**Theorem 2.** $K$ is compact in $X$ $\implies$ $K$ is closed (compact sets are closed).

**Proof.**
- We will show that for a compact set $K$, $K^c$ is open (which means $K$ is closed).
- Take any point $p$ outside of $K$ and show that there is an open ball around it that misses $K$.
- For every point $q \in K$, let $U_q = N(q, \Delta/2)$ and $V_q = N(p, \Delta/2)$, where $\Delta = d(p, q)$.
    - open balls around $q$ and $p$, with radius _half_ of the distance between the two points.
    - these balls exist because $\Delta = 0 \iff p = q$, which is impossible because $q \in K$ and $p \in K^c$.
- Then $\{U_q\}$ is an open cover of $K$, and a finite subcover $\{U_{q_i}\}$ exists.
- Let $V = \bigcap V_{q_i}$ (i.e. the "smallest" ball around $p$).
    - $V \cap K = \emptyset$ because if a point $s \in V$, $s \notin U_{q_i} \forall q_i, \implies s \notin \bigcup U_{q_i}$.
    - Since $K \subset \bigcup U_{q_i}$ ($K$ is covered by that union), $s \notin K$.
    - Therefore $V$ is that open ball around $p$ that is completely in $K^c$. $\blacksquare$

This theorem also tells us that **if $K$ is not closed, then it is not compact.**

<Box>

**Closed and bounded sets** are not necessarily compact in all metric spaces, but they are compact in $\R$ (**Heine-Borel theorem**, covered in the next lecture).

</Box>

**Theorem 3.** A closed subset $B$ of a compact set $K$ is compact.

**Proof.**
- Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $B$.
- We want to find a finite subcover of $B$.
- Because $B$ is closed, $\{B^c\} \cup \{U_\alpha\}$ is an open cover of $K$.
- By compactness, a finite subcover exists, namely $\{B^c\} \cup \{U_{\alpha_i}\}$.
- Then $\{U_{\alpha_i}\}$ is a finite subcover of $\{U_\alpha\}$, because $B^c$ definitely does not cover any points of $B$. $\blacksquare$

**Corollary.** Given set $F$ closed, set $K$ compact in $X$, $F \cap K$ is compact.

**Theorem 4.**
- Nested closed intervals in $\R$ are not empty.
- Nested closed $k$-cells (closed boxes) in $\R^k$ are not empty.

**Proof.**
- Let $x = \sup \{a_i\}$, which exists because they are bounded by $b_1$ and we are in $\R$ (completeness).
- By definition, $x \geq a_i$ for all $a_i$.
- $x \leq b_n$ for all $b_n$ because $b_n$ is an upper bound for all $a_i$, and $x$ is the _least_ upper bound ($\sup$).
- So, at least $x$ is in the nested closed intervals.

This theorem can be used to prove that $\R$ is **uncountable**.
