# Lecture 7. Countable and Uncountable Sets

**How do we count?** We construct a function that maps objects to the natural numbers.

## A review of functions

Recall: A function is $f: A \rightarrow B$. It associates $x \mapsto f(x)$.

- $A$ is the **domain** of the function.
- $B$ is the **codomain** of the function.
    - The **range** is the subset of $B$ with values that actually get mapped to.

- If $C \subset A, D \subset B$
    - then $f(C) = \{f(x): x \in C\}$ is the **image** of $C$.
    - then $f^{-1}(D) = \{x: f(x) \in D\}$ is the **inverse image** of $D$.
        - the inverse image is not necessarily a function; because multiple values can map to a single value via $f$, $f^{-1}$ may map a single value to multiple values.
- When **f(A) = B**, say $f$ is **onto** (a **surjection**).
    - Denote $f: A \twoheadrightarrow B$.
- When $f(x) = f(y) \implies x = y$, say $f$ to **one-to-one** (an **injection**).
    - Denote $f: A \hookrightarrow B$.
- When $f$ is one-to-one and onto, call $f$ a **bijection** and say $A$ and $B$ are in **one-to-one correspondence**.
    - Denote $f: A \xrightarrow{b} B$.
    - Denote &ldquo;$A$ and $B$ are in one-to-one correspondence&rdquo; as $A \sim B$.

## Counting

**Definition (elementary counting).** Create a bijection between the set we want to count and $J_n = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$.

**Definition (finite).** A set $A$ is **finite** if $A \sim J_n$ for some $n \in \N$. Otherwise $A$ is **infinite**.

**Definition (countable).** A set $A$ is **countable** if $A \sim \N$.

- **(S1).** $\N$ is countable: use $f: \N \xrightarrow{b} \N$ where $f(n) = n$.
- **(S2).** A sequence $S = x_1, x_2, x_3, ...$ of distinct terms is countable. Use $f: \N \xrightarrow{b} S$ where $f(n) = x_n$.
    - **Moral.** A set that can be **listed in a sequence is countable**!

**Theorem.** $\N$ is infinite.

**Proof (sketch, by induction).** Induct on $n$ and show $\N \nsim J_n$.
- **Base case.** Suppose $\exists f_1: J_1 \xrightarrow{b} \N$, consider $\N \smallsetminus f_1(1)$. It's not empty, and thus $f_1$ is not bijective.
- **Inductive case (by contradiction).** We'll show $J_k \nsim \N \implies J_{k+1} \nsim \N$.
    - Suppose $J_{k+1} \overset{f}{\sim} \N$. Then $J_k \sim \N' = \N \smallsetminus \{f^{-1}(k+1)\}$, but $\N' \sim \N$. Therefore $J_k \sim \N$, a contradiction.

The interesting idea is that we define size (cardinality) by a **bijection**, rather than a **number**.

**Theorem.** Every infinite subset $E$ of a countable set $A$ is countable.

**Proof (sketch).**
- We want to count the elements of $E$ that are a subset of $A = \{x_1, x_2, x_3, ...\}$.
    - The elements in $E$ can be associated with the subscript $i$ that indexes them in $A$.
- Let $n_1 = \inf \{i : x_i \in E\}$ (least element exists by the WOP, because the indices are natural numbers).
- Let $n_2 = \inf \{i : x_i \in E, i > n_1\}$, etc.
- Let $n_k = \inf \{i : x_i \in E, i > n_{k-1}\}$, etc.
- Then $E = \{x_{n_1}, x_{n_2}, ...\}$ is countable. $\blacksquare$

**Corollary.** $\Q$ is countable.

**Proof.** Traverse through the ordered pairs in a diagonal fashion. That shows the ordered pairs is countable. We can select only the subset of unique rationals, and because every infinite subset of a countable set is countable, $\Q$ is countable.

**Theorem.** A countable union of countable sets is countable.

**Proof.** Similar proof to $\Q$ is countable, list out all the elements in every member of the union and traverse diagonally.

## Is $\R$ countable?

**Theorem.** $\R$ is not countable.

**Proof (by contradiction).**

Suppose there is a bijection, e.g.

```
1 -> 0.(1)23456789012...
2 -> 0.3(1)4159265358...
3 -> 0.14(1)421351111...
4 -> 0.777(7)77771234...
5 -> 0.4132(4)1089923...
```

- We will show that the listing is bijection is not **onto**, i.e. produce a number that doesn't appear anywhere else in the list.
- We will do so by producing a number that disagrees with every number in the list at **at least** one decimal location.
    - Create $x$ that has a different value than every parenthesized value above.
- This proof **doesn't work for the rationals** because the produced number $x$ is not necessarily rational.

**Theorem.** For any $A$, $A \nsim \mathcal{P}(A)$ (the power set of $A$).
