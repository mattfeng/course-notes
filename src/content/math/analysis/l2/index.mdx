# Lecture 2. Properties of $\Q$

- Questions
    - How do we define **arithmetic structure** ($\{+, \cdot \}$) on $\Q$?
    - In what sense does $\Q$ extend $\Z$?

## Arithmetic: addition and multiplication

**Checking that a definition is well-defined**
- Assume
    - $a \sim a'$
    - $b \sim b'$
- Must check that
    - $f(a, b) \sim f(a', b')$
- The answer **should not depend on the representatives chosen**.

</Box>

- **Define** $\dfrac{a}{b} + \dfrac{c}{d} = \dfrac{ad+bc}{bd}$.
- **Define** $\dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{c}{d} = \dfrac{ac}{bd}$.
- $\Q$ extends $\Z$ via the **isomorphism** $n \mapsto \dfrac{n}{1}$.

## Properties

### $\Q$ has order

- **Definition (Order).** An **order** on a set $S$ is a relation $<$ satisfying
    1. **trichotomy.** if $x, y \in S$, exactly one of the following is true: $x < y$, $x = y$, $y < x$.
    2. **transitivity.** for $x, y, z \in S$, if $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$.
    - $(S, <)$ is called an **ordered set**.
- e.g. in $\Z$, say $m < n$ if $n - m \in \{1, 2, 3, ...\}$.
- e.g. in $\Q$,
    - Define $\dfrac{m}{n}$ as **positive** if $mn > 0$.
    - so $\dfrac{a}{b} < \dfrac{c}{d}$ if $\dfrac{c}{d} + \dfrac{-a}{b}$ is positive.
- We write $y > x$ for $x < y$.
- We write $x \leq y$ for $x < y$ or $x = y$.

### $\Q$ is a field
- Note: $\Z$ is a **ring**.
- **Definition (Field)**. A **field** $(F, + , \cdot)$ satisfies the following axioms:
    1. **closure.**
    2. **commutative.**
    3. **associative.**
    4. **identities.** The additive identity is denoted $0$; the multiplicative identity is denoted $1$.
    5. **inverse.** Every element has an **additive inverse**. Every element except $0$ has a **multiplicative inverse**.
    6. **distributive.** $\cdot$ distributes over $+$.

### $\Q$ is an ordered field
- **Definition (Ordered field).** An **ordered field** is a field with order where the order is _preserved_ by the field operations:
    1. $y < z \implies x + y < x + z$.
    2. $y < z, x > 0 \implies xy < xz$.

$\Q$ helps us solve equations $\Z$ could not, but $\Q$ is still not big enough.

**Theorem**. $x^2 = 2$ has no solution in $\Q$.

**Proof (by contradiction, extremal principle)**.
- Assume $x^2 = 2$ has a solution $\dfrac{p}{q} \in \Q$, and $p, q$ have no common factors (extremal principle).
- So $\left(\dfrac{p}{q}\right)^2 = 2$. Then $p^2 = 2q^2$.
- $p$ must be even in order for $p^2$ to have a factor of 2. So $p$ is even.
- So $p = 2k$ for some $k \in \Z$.
- So $4k^2 = 2q^2$, or $2k^2 = q^2$. So $q$ is even.
- But if $p, q$ are both even, contradicting the assumption that $p, q$ have no common factor.
- Thus there is no solution to $x^2 = 2$ in $\Q$.
