# Generalized Linear Model (GLM)

## The main ideas
1. Use least-squares to fit a line to the data
2. Calculate $R^2$
3. Calculate a $p$-value for $R^2$

## 1. Fit a line to the data

## 2. Calculating $R^2$

### Adjusted $R^2$
- Scale $R^2$ by the number of parameters
- Used to normalize the effect of having too many parameters improving performance by chance

## 3. Calculate a $p$-value for $R^2$

$$F = the variation explained by factors / the variation not explained by factors$$

$$F = \frac{SS(mean) - SS(fit) / (p_fit - p_mean)}{SS(fit) / (n - p_fit)}$$

- $p_fit$. number of parameters in the fit line
- $p_mean$. number of parameters in the mean line
- $n - p_fit$. more data = more likely that $F$ is accurate
    - $p_fit$ data points aren't really data; they will fit anything
- $F$ distribution.
