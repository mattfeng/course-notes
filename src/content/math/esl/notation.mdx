# notation

- $X$. input variable
    - $X_j$. component $j$ of input variable vector $X$
    - $X$ has $p$ components (i.e. $p$ input variables consolidated into one "super" input variable $X$)
- $Y$. quantitative **output**
- $G$. qualitative **output** ($G$ for _group_)
- _observed values_ are written in lowercase
    - $x_i$ is the $i$th observation of input variable $X$
- $N$ is the number of examples
- vectors in bold have $N$ components
    - $\mathbf{x}_j$ is the $N$-vector containing all the observations on variable $X_j$.
- all vectors are assumed to be column vectors
- hats, such as $\hat{Y}$, represent predictions
