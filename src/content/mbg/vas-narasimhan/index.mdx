- random
  - has a standing desk

## Discussion
- spent a summer interning at McKinsey working anti-viral treamtment for Botswana (business side of therapeutics)
- worked at Novartis Vaccines (newly acquired)

  - How do you sustain investment in pandemic (emergency) preparedness?

  - Therapeutics and vaccines within 24 months

### Novartis's approach to innovation
- culture of innovation, **unbossed environment**
  - knowledge workers don't respond to carrot/stick incentives
  - need to give them a strong sense of 
    - purpose
    - mastery (growth)
    - autonomy
- **digital science**
  - first breakthrough: monitoring clinical trials
    - a single room where you can see all the clinical trial statuses and enrollment

### Q&A
- Referencing Vas's previous infectious disease work; how can be better incentivize R&D in infectious diseases?
  - Philanthropy for tropical diseases
  - Antimicrobial resistance
    - the science is really hard
    - antibotics need to be manufactured at a dedicated plant
      - **$500 to 750 million**
    - generally reserved for last-line of therapy (returns are very difficult to generate)
- Current estimates of time/money to commercialize a drug (10 years, $1bn); where can pharmaceutical companies reduce these numbers and make treatments cheaper?
  - Averages bad; different kinds of development costs
    - e.g. New drug: need 7 year outcome study
    - e.g. Gene therapy program
      - can prove efficacy with 50 patients and streamlined development program
  - Cost comes from the **wide number of failures**
    - Need better understanding of biology
    - Need better models of humans (organ-on-chip)
- Balancing innovation with success and efficiency? It is difficult to get wide backgrounds (perspectives) in a single meeting.
  - Creative abrasion
    - Intellectual conflict without personal conflict
  - Need to train team leadership skills
- In academia, fear of working on a problem that industry can do better. What are academia's strengths, versus industry's?
  - True, basic drug discovery (basic science) is best done by academia
    - e.g. determine **drug targets**
  - Novartis invests $2.7bn in basic drug discovery
  - Industry has capability to take **drug target** and **drug it**
  - **Novartis works with Microsoft Research**
  - with AI and data science, much more open (both academia and industry)
- How do you oversee everything going on in a large company?
  - aside: Novartis is passionate about **degraders**.
  - Build **systems** that help you monitor complex organizations.
  - Need to learn that CEOs control very little.
  - Governance meetings: review key areas.
  - **Need to be clear what decisions the CEO needs to make, and what can be delegated**.
  - Using data science, Novartis knows sales, marketing, clinical trials in almost real time.
    - The hard part is _not reacting to that data_, just keeping it in mind.
  - Ask yourself: what is my role, and what is my team's role, and be disciplined (keep them separate) about it.
  - Gut reaction: best **lab directors** are the ones that let their teams run.
- Strategy and entering/exiting therapeutic areas; how do you balance the cinician's viewpoint and the business's viewpoint?
  - Might wait too long before exiting.
  - Mix of questions
    - Exiting: Do we have the scientific capabilities and pipeline to sustain ourselves in a therapeutic area?
  - Entering: is there high imminent need?
    - e.g. Renal (new)
    - e.g. Liver (difficult, but continuing programs)
    - e.g. Gene therapies for neuroscience (new)
- Graduate school focuses on individual and lab interests; medicine focuses on people; pharma focuses on business. How do you balance all three of these?
  - Novartis has a consistent investment in LMIC conditions.
  - Ranked number 1 in access in LMIC.
  - Decide where you can impact the most, and how you can transfer profits into that area.
- Advice on building management skills?
  - TODO: Recommended books on **how to lead**
  - Amy Edmondson
    - **Psychological Security**
- What is the ideal partnership between academia and industry? How do we strengthen that relationship (practical actions)?
  - Many different kinds of partnerships
  - Comes down to people
    - Academia needs someone with a _vision_
    - Industry needs to see a _business potential_
  - Be sure to stay the course if a partnership is forged
    - e.g. Novartis/DFCI partnership
  - Novartis thinking: Can Novartis work more upstream (work directly with researchers) than through venture capital?
