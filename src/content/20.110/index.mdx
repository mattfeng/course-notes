## unit 1: first law of thermodynamics

### thermochemistry

### standard enthalpy of reaction ($\Delta_{\text{rxn}} H^\circ$)
- standard enthalpy of reaction is a reaction conducted at <C chem="\pu{1 atm}" />

### kirchoff's law of thermochemistry
- [Wikipedia](https://archive.is/gwMui)

### adiabatic processes
- no heat: $q = 0$

## unit 2: second law of thermodynamics

### lec 9: introduction to entropy (2021-09-29)
- for **solids and liquids**, $C_p = C_v$
- for **gases**, $C_p > C_v$ because the system can expand

#### entropy
- remember that $S$ is a state function: so you can calculate $\Delta S$ for irreversible processes by creating a reversible path
- in cold packs in first aid kits, <C chem="\ce{NH4NO2(s) + H2O(l) -> NH4NO3(aq)}" />
    - endothermic: $\Delta_r H^{\circ} =$ <C chem="\pu{25.7 kJ/mol}" />
- **tautomer.** constitutional isomers that readily interconvert (often in solution).

### lec 10: (2021-10-04)

### lec 11: second law of thermodynamics (2021-10-06)

### lec 12: free energy (1) (2021-10-08)

### lec 13: free energy (2) (2021-10-13)
- **Helmholtz free energy.** $A = U-TS$
    - for a constant temperature and volume process, $\Delta A < 0 \implies$ spontaneous reaction (i.e., $\Delta A < 0$ is a criterion for spontaneity)
- understanding &ldquo;free energy&rdquo;
    - Gibbs
        - $\Delta H$. total energy released in a reaction
        - $T\Delta S$. energy released in a disordered form
    - Helmholtz
        - $\Delta U$.
        - $T\Delta S$.

_todo: use Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to derive equation (13-2)_
