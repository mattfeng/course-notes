## lec 18: intro to stat mech

- **statistical definition of entropy (postulate).** $S = k_B \ln W$
    - $W$ is the number of microstates
    - $k_B = R / N_A$ is Boltzmann's constant
    - the _logarithm_ is mathematically useful (multiplication of probabilities becomes additive)
- **stirling's approximation.** $\ln (x!) \approx x \ln x - x$
