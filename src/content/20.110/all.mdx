## thermochemistry

### standard enthalpy of reaction ($\Delta_{\text{rxn}} H^\circ$)
- standard enthalpy of reaction is a reaction conducted at <C chem="\pu{1 atm}" />

### kirchoff's law of thermochemistry
- [Wikipedia](https://archive.is/gwMui)

## adiabatic processes
- no heat: $q = 0$

## entropy
- remember that $S$ is a state function: so you can calculate $\Delta S$ for irreversible processes by creating a reversible path
