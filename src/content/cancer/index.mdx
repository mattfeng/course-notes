# Cancer

- **unmarked oncogenes**. genes that are not genetically activated by mutation (mutation, amplification, or translocation) but are similarly important oncogenic drivers.
  - e.g. support genes in **non-oncogene addiction**
- **marked oncogenes**. genes that are oncogenic due to mutation.
- **context-specific oncogenes**. genes are that are only oncogenic in certain cell types.
- levels of chemoprevention
  - **primary**. given to healthy population to reduce risk factors
  - **secondary**. prevent progression of pre-malignancies
  - **tertiary**. prevent recurrence of cancers
- chemoprevention drugs currently
  - colorectal cancer
    - NSAIDS
- **aspirin** reduced the risk of cancer with distant metastasis, particularly for adenocarcinomas
