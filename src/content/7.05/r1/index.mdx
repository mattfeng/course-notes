# Recitation 1. 

## Lecture 1. Classes of biomolecules
- **hydrolysis**. add water
- **condensation**. remove water

### Proteins
- proteins are formed by making **amide bonds**
- the **trans** form is favored over **cis**
  - due to sterics
  - except for **proline**; both isomers are essentially equally favored

### Nucleic acids

TODO: insert diagram of nucleic acid
- **phosphoester bond**
  - $\ce{O=P-O}$

### Carbohydrates

### Lipids

### pH
- assumptions made
  1. autoionization of water doesn't contribute significant amounts of proton.
  2. weak acid/base means that a low amount of conjugate base/acid is formed

### Titration
- **"equivalents of base (EOB)"**
  - equivalence point is when EOB = 1
  - half-titration point (when EOB = 0.5), is when $\PH = \PK{a}$.
