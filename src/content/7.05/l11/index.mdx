## Readings

### 12<SPACE/>Introduction

### 12.1<SPACE/>Fatty acids are key constituents of lipids

### 12.2<SPACE/>There are three common types of membrane lipids

### 12.3<SPACE/>Phospholipids and glycolipids readily form bimolecular sheets in aqueous media

### Blood clotting (10.4)

#### Blood clotting is accomplished by a cascade of zymogen activations

#### Prothrombin requires a vitamin K-dependent modification for activation

#### Fibrinogen is converted by thrombin into a fibrin clot

#### Vitamin K is required for the formation of $\gamma$-carboxyglutamate

#### The clotting process must be precisely regulated

#### Hemophilia revealed an early step in clotting

### 9.4<SPACE/>Myosins harness changes in enzyme conformation to couple ATP hydrolysis to mechanical work

### 14.5<SPACE />Defects in signal-transduction pathways can lead to cancer and other diseases
