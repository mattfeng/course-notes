## Readings

### 8.5<SPACE/>Enzymes can be inhibited by specific molecules
- types of reversible inhibition
  - **competitive**. E can only bind I or S, but not both
    - decreases the fraction of enzyme bound to substrate
    - _can be overcome by adding more substrate_
  - **uncompetitive**. I binds to ES
    - _cannot be overcome by adding more substrate_
  - **noncompetitive**. I binds to different site, deactivating enzyme
    - works by decreasing concentration of functional enzyme
    - _cannot be overcome by adding more substrate_

#### The different kinds of reversible inhibitors are kinetically distinguishable

- dissociation constant for inhibitor: $K_i = \dfrac{\ce{[E][I]}}{\ce{[EI]}}$
  - smaller $K_i$ means stronger inhibitor
- slope of LB plot: $\dfrac{K_M}{\Vmax}$
- y intercept: $\dfrac{1}{\Vmax}$
- x intercept: $-\dfrac{1}{K_M}$

##### Competitive
- $V_{\max}$ unchanged
- $K_M$ increased
  - new value called $\Kmapp = K_M(1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}) = K_M(1 + \dfrac{\ce{[EI]}}{\ce{[E]}})$
- LB
  - Slope increased by factor of $1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}$

##### Uncompetitive
- $\Vmax$ decreases by factor of $1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}$
- $K_M$ decreases by factor of $1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}$
  - $$K_M = \dfrac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$$
  - $K_M$ decreases because I binds ES forming ESI, and by Le Chatelier's principle more E and S will bind to form ES, increasing the apparent value of $k_1$
- LB
  - slope unchanged
  - y intercept increases by factor of $1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}$
  - x intercept increases by factor of $1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}$ (but x-intercept is negative, so it becomes _more negative_)

##### Noncompetitive
- **pure noncompetitive**
  - $K_i$ is same for both
    - $\ce{E + I <=> EI}$
    - $\ce{ES + I <=> ESI}$
- $\Vmax$ decreases; $\Vamax = \dfrac{\Vmax}{1 + \frac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}}$
- $K_M$ unchanged
  - simply reduces concentration of functional enzyme
  - EI pulls down LHS of $\ce{E + S <=> ES}$, Le Chatelier's shift towards left
  - ESI pulls down RHS of $\ce{E + S <=> ES}$, Le Chatelier's shift towards right
  - no net change on reaction rate $k_1$ or $k_{-1}$
- LB
  - x intercept unchanged
  - y intercept increases by factor of $1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}$
  - slope increases by factor of $1 + \dfrac{\ce{[I]}}{K_i}$

#### Irreversible inhibitors can be used to map the active site
- inhibitors modify functional groups, which can then be identified
- three categories of irreversible inhibitors:
  1. **group-specific reagents**
  2. **reactive substrate analogs (a.k.a. affinity labels)**
  3. **suicide inhibitors**
- **group-specific reagents**
  - react with specific side chains of amino acids
  - e.g. DIPF
    - serine protease trypsin
    - acetylcholinesterase
- **reactive substrate analogs (a.k.a. affinity labels)**
  - structurally similar to substrate and covalently bind to active-site residues
  - e.g. **tosyl-<L/>-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)** for chymotrypsin
    - binds to His57
  - e.g. **3-bromoacetol phosphate** for triose phosphate isomerase
- **suicide inhibitors (mechanism-based inhibitors)**
  - modified substrates that generate reactive intermediate that inactivates enzyme through covalent modification

#### Penicillin irreversible inactivates a key enzyme in bacterial cell-wall synthesis
