# Lecture 21. Introduction to Metabolic Pathways, Polysaccharides, Bioenergetics

## Pre-lecture notes
- **metabolism**. chemical reactions all cells/organisms use to
  1. extract energy from the environment (catabolism)
  2. synthesize macromolecules that make up all life (anabolism)
- **reducing sugar**. any sugar that can access the open-chain form;

## Lecture notes

2. Polysaccharide structure and function
3. Introduction to bioenergetics
4. Role of $\Delta G$ in reactions and pathways

### Notes
- **metabolism**. chemical reactions all cells/organisms use to
  1. extract energy from the environment (catabolism)
  2. synthesize macromolecules that make up all life (anabolism)
- metabolism is needed to _fight entropy_
