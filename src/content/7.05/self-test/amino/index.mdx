# Amino acid self test

- To test
    - Three letter code
    - One letter code
    - pKa side chain
    - Kind of amino acid
        - Hydrophobic (9)
        - Polar (6)
        - Negative (2), Acidic (have COOH group)
        - Positive (3), Basic (have positively charged group at neutral pH)
    - Other amino acid properties
        - Large/Bulky
        - Ionizable (7)
            - arginine
            - lysine
            - histidine
            - aspartic acid
            - glutamic acid
            - tyrosine
            - cysteine
- pKa of ionizable groups
- Go through the alphabet. Write every amino acid.
- What is the chirality of the $\beta$-carbon in isoleucine?
- What is the chirality of the $\beta$-carbon in threonine?
