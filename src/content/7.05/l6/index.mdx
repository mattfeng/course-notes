## Readings

### pp. 191-212

- supplying oxygen to the body
  1. circulatory system that actively delivers oxygen to cells in body
  2. use of oxygen-transport and oxygen-storage proteins: **hemoglobin** (blood) and **myoglobin** (muscles)
- myoglobin and hemoglobin were first proteins with 3D structured determined by XRC
- first examples of mutations as basis of disease: sickle-cell anemia

#### 7.1<SPACE />Myoglobin and hemoglobin bind oxygen at iron atoms in heme
- **prosthetic group**. a molecule that binds tightly to a protein and is essential for its function
- $\ce{Fe^2+}$ state is capable of binding oxygen ($\ce{Fe^3+}$ is other form that can exist)
- myoglobin: **fifth coordination site** occupied by imidazole ring of a histidine residue; the **proximal histidine**
- oxygen binding at the **six coordination site**
- **fMRI detects the change in heme electronic structure that occurs when oxygen binds**
  - signals from protons in water molecules are altered by the magnetic properties of hemoglobin
  - the magnetic properties change depending on binding to oxygen
- **The structure of myoglobin prevents the release of reactive oxygen species**
  - heme-oxygen bond is a complex between a $\ce{Fe^3+}$ ion and $\ce{O2-}$ (superoxide anion) .
  - oxygen must leave myoglobin as dioxygen and not superoxide
    - if iron left in ferric state: **metmyoglobin** $\to$ cannot store oxygen!
    - superoxide is a reactive oxygen species; damaging!
    - this is accomplished with a **distal histidine** that donates a hydrogen bond to the bound oxygen molecule, stabilizing the superoxide
- **Human hemoglobin is an assembly of four myoglobin-like subunits**
  - **hemoglobin A (HbA)**. the hemoglobin tetramer
  - four heme groups
    - iron-iron distances of $24$ to $\pu{40 \ang}$

#### 7.2<SPACE />Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively
- oxygen-binding curve
  - **fractional saturation (Y)** vs. $\ce{pO2}$
    - $Y$. the fraction of possible binding sites that contain bound oxygen
  - in lungs, $\ce{pO2} \approx \pu{100 torr}$
  - in resting tissues, $\ce{pO2} \approx \pu{40 torr}$
  - in actively metabolizing tissues, $\ce{pO2} \approx \pu{20 torr}$
  - due to cooperativity, hemoglobin has the property where it prioritizes actively metabolizing tissue in delivering oxygen
  - myoglobin binds too tightly for useful release
  - no cooperativity hemoglobin binds too loosely (not enough $\ce{O2}$ captured)
  - hemoglobin allows for **66% of binding sites** to contribute to oxygen transport
- **Oxygen binding markedly changes the quaternary structure of hemoglobin**
  - upon binding of oxygen, $\alpha_1\beta_1$ and $\alpha_2\beta_2$ dimers rotate approximately 15 degrees with respect to one another.
  - dimers are _freer to move_ in the oxygenated state than in deoxygenated state ($R$, relaxed state)
    - binding sites, when relaxed, are free of strain and able to bind oxygen with higher affinity
- **Hemoglobin cooperativity can be potentially explained by several models**
  - **concerted/MWC model**.
    - binding of ligand _shifts equilibrium_ between T and R states
    - only two states: T and R
  - **sequential model**.
    - 5 different binding states, each with increasing affinity
  - reality: concerted because 3 oxygen bound is in R state, but sequential because 1 oxygen bound is in T state with 3x affinity (vs 20x for R state)
- **Structural changes at the heme groups are transmitted to the $\alpha_1\beta_1$-$\alpha_2\beta_2$ interface.**
  - iron moving into plane of porphyrin ring is transmitted to interface through the **proximal histidine** and the alpha helix it is attached to
- **2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in red cells is crucial in determining the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.**
  - T state is actually unstable; hemoglobin naturally will bind too tightly to oxygen (won't release it)
  - 2,3-BPG stabilizes the T state.

#### 7.3<SPACE />Hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide promote the release of oxygen: the Bohr effect

#### 7.4<SPACE />Mutations in genes encoding hemoglobin subunits can result in disease

### pp. 286-292

#### 10.1<SPACE />Aspartate transcarbamoylase is allosterically inhibited by the end product of its pathway

### pp. 356-358

#### 12.5<SPACE />Lipids and many membrane proteins diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane

## Questions
- Why does the distal histidine's hydrogen bond prevent superoxide from leaving (and instead only encourages dioxygen leaving)?
