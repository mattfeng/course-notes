## Readings

### pp. 191-212

- supplying oxygen to the body
  1. circulatory system that actively delivers oxygen to cells in body
  2. use of oxygen-transport and oxygen-storage proteins: **hemoglobin** (blood) and **myoglobin** (muscles)
- myoglobin and hemoglobin were first proteins with 3D structured determined by XRC
- first examples of mutations as basis of disease: sickle-cell anemia

#### 7.1<SPACE />Myoglobin and hemoglobin bind oxygen at iron atoms in heme
- **prosthetic group**. a molecule that binds tightly to a protein and is essential for its function
- $\ce{Fe^2+}$ state is capable of binding oxygen ($\ce{Fe^3+}$ is other form that can exist)
- myoglobin: **fifth coordination site** occupied by imidazole ring of a histidine residue; the **proximal histidine**
- oxygen binding at the **six coordination site**
- **fMRI detects the change in heme electronic structure that occurs when oxygen binds**
  - signals from protons in water molecules are altered by the magnetic properties of hemoglobin
  - the magnetic properties change depending on binding to oxygen
- **The structure of myoglobin prevents the release of reactive oxygen species**
  - heme-oxygen bond is a complex between a $\ce{Fe^3+}$ ion and $\ce{O2-}$ (superoxide anion) .
  - oxygen must leave myoglobin as dioxygen and not superoxide
    - if iron left in ferric state: **metmyoglobin** $\to$ cannot store oxygen!
    - superoxide is a reactive oxygen species; damaging!

#### 7.2<SPACE />Hemoglobin binds oxygen cooperatively

#### 7.3<SPACE />Hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide promote the release of oxygen: the Bohr effect

#### 7.4<SPACE />Mutations in genes encoding hemoglobin subunits can result in disease

### pp. 286-292

#### 10.1<SPACE />Aspartate transcarbamoylase is allosterically inhibited by the end product of its pathway

### pp. 356-358

#### 12.5<SPACE />Lipids and many membrane proteins diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane
