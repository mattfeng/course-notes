### 30<SPACE/>Protein synthesis

### 30.1<SPACE/>Protein synthesis requires the translation of nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences

### 30.2<SPACE/>Aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetases read the genetic code

### 30.3<SPACE/>The ribosome is the site of protein synthesis

### 30.4<SPACE/>Eukaryotic protein synthesis differs from bacterial protein synthesis primarily in translation initiation

### 30.5<SPACE/>A variety of antibiotics and toxins can inhibit protein synthesis
