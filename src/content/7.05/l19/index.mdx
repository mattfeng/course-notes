## Lecture notes

### Key points
1. tRNA structure: modified bases, non-WC base pairs
2. tRNA charging with amino acids
3. wobble base and non-Watson Crick base pairs
4. tRNA synthetase and "double-sieve mechanism"
5. initiation phase of protein translation

### 1<SPACE/>tRNA structure: modified bases, non-WC base pairs

### 2<SPACE/>tRNA charging with amino acids
- two steps
  1. adenylation to make mixed anhydride
      - $\ce{AA + ATP ->[tRNA synthetase] X + PPi}$
  2. acylation

### 3<SPACE/>Wobble base and non-Watson Crick base pairs

### 4<SPACE/>tRNA synthetase and "double-sieve mechanism"
- 2 classes
  - **Class 1**. link to 2'-OH
    - R, C, Q, E, I, L, M, W, Y, V
  - **Class 2**. link to 3'-OH
    - A, N, D, G, H, K, F, S, P, T
  - 2'-OH and 3'-OH are interconvertible
- **specificity**. charging the tRNA with the right amino acid
  - two levels of discrimination: **double sieve**

### 5<SPACE/>Initiation phase of protein translation
- **only focusing on _E. coli_**
- ribosome: 2/3 RNA, 1/3 protein (by weight)
  - 2600 kDa
- 20000 ribosomes in each cell
- ~25% dry mass of cell
- 250 Ã…, roughly spherical
- ultracentrifuge
  - **70S** in weight
    - **50S**
      - **23S** rRNA
      - **5S** rRNA
      - 36 proteins (**L{1..36}**, L for large)
    - **30S**
      - **16S** rRNA
      - 21 proteins (**S{1..21}**, S for small)
  - near end of **16S** has `UCCU` sequence

#### Translation on ribosome
- ingredients
  - ribosome
  - mRNA
  - charged tRNA
- 3 stages
  1. initiation
      - **initiation factors (IFs)**: G proteins
  2. elongation
      - **elongation factors (EFs)**: G proteins
  3. termination
      - termination factors

#### Translation initiation
- starts with `AUG` (start codon)

```
AGGA.....AUG....
^        ^ start codon
Shine-Delgarno sequence
```

- the tRNA for the start codon carries **_N_-formyl methionine**
