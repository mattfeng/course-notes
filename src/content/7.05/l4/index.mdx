#### 2.3<SPACE />Secondary structure: polypeptide chains can fold into regular structures such as the alpha helix, beta sheet, turns, and loops
- beta turn
- omega loop
- **the alpha helix is a coiled structure stabilized by intrachain hydrogen bonds**
  - **4 residues away**
    - 3.6 residues per turn of helix
    - rise per residue: $\pu{1.5 \ang}$
      - pitch = $\pu{3.6 \times 1.5 \ang = 5.4 \ang}$
  - **side chains point outward**
  - destabilize $\alpha$-helix:
    - branching at $\beta$-carbon
      - valine, threonine, isoleucine
    - hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors that compete for main-chain NH and CO groups
      - serine
      - aspartate
      - asparagine
    - no NH group, ring structure
      - **proline** (only a $\alpha$-helix)
- **beta sheets are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between polypeptide strands**
- **beta turn**
  - 4 residues
  - hydrogen bond between CO of $i$ and NH of $i + 3$
- **fibrous proteins provide structural support for cells and tissues**
  - **keratin**
    - repeating seven amino acid sequence called **heptad repeat**
    - every seventh residue is **leucine**
  - **collagen**
    - glycine, proline, hydroxyproline
    - no hydrogen bonds
    - stabilized by steric repulsion of pyrrolidine rings of proline and hydroxyproline
    - superhelical cable of 3 strands is stabilized by hydrogen bonds
