## Readings

### 11<SPACE/> Introduction

### 11.1<SPACE/>Monosaccharides are the simplest carbohydrates

### 11.2<SPACE/>Monosaccharides are linked to form complex carbohydrates

### 11.3<SPACE/>Carbohydrates can be linked to proteins to form glycoproteins

### 11.4<SPACE/>Lectins are specific carbohydrate-binding proteins

### 13<SPACE/>Membrane channels and pumps

### 13.1<SPACE/>The transport of molecules across a membrane may be active or passive

### 13.2<SPACE/>Two families of membrane proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump ions and molecules across membranes

### 13.3<SPACE/>Lactose permease is an archetype of secondary transporters that use one concentration gradient to power the formation of another

### 13.4<SPACE/>Specific channels can rapidly transport ions across membranes

### 13.5<SPACE/>Gap junctions allow ions and small molecules to flow between communicating cells

### 13.6<SPACE/>Specific channels increase the permeability of some membranes to water
