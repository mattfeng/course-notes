## Readings

### 1.2<SPACE/>DNA illustrates the interplay between form and function

### 4.1<SPACE/>A nucleic acid consists of four kinds of bases linked to a sugar-phosphate backbone
- DNA is a linear polymer

#### RNA and DNA differ in the sugar component and one of the bases
- DNA: deoxyribose
- RNA: ribose
- the negative charge on the phosphodiester backbone **repels nucleophilic species which are capable of hydrolytic attack on the backbone**

#### Nucleotides are the monomeric units of nucleic acids
- 

### 4.2<SPACE/>A pair of nucleic acid strands with complementary sequences can form a double-helical structure

### 4.3<SPACE/>The double helix facilitates the accurate transmission of hereditary information

### 4.4<SPACE/>DNA is replicated by polymerases that take instructions from templates
