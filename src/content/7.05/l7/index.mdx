# Lecture 7. Hemoglobin and the Bohr Effect

## Lecture notes

- how to get phase: **heavy atom derivatives**
  - Au, Hg, Pt; sit at defined sites on protein
  - act as reference markers
- **resolution**. 
  - based on how the scattering happened: how much of the diffraction pattern (the radius from the center) was usable
  - $\ce{6 \ang}$: polypeptide chains
  - $\ce{3 \ang}$; alpha helices, beta strands
  - $1.5$ to $2.5 \pu{\ang}$; non hydrogen atoms
- **myoglobin**
  - **globin fold**
  - 153 AA, single chain
- **hemoglobin**
  - $p_{50} = \pu{27 mmHg}$
  - $p\ce{O2}_{\text{lung}} = \pu{100 mmHg}$
  - $p\ce{O2}_{\text{tissue}} \in \pu{[20,40] mmHg}$ 
  - **sigmoidal curve** is a sign of **cooperativity**
  - $p\ce{CO2}$ increases or $\pH$ drops
    - curve shifts to the **right**
    - the hemoglobin will release even more oxygen
  - increased $\pH$, decrease in $p\ce{CO2}$
    - curve shifts to the **left**
  - **Bohr effect**. the dissociation curve shifts if the $\pH$ increases/decreases and/or $p\ce{CO2}$ increases/decreases
  - structure
    - 2 $\alpha$ chains
    - 2 $\beta$ chains
    - 1 tetramer formed
  - in a RBC, $\ce{[Hb]}$ is high (33% hemoglobin)
- **deoxyHb vs. oxyHb**
  - little change in tertiary structure
  - main chage is in quaternary structure
  - **switch regions** contain
    - salt bridges and hydrogen bonds
    - in transition from deoxy to oxy, 8 salt bridges/hydrogen bonds are broken
  - oxygen _does not need to be present_ to be in the **oxy state**.
- **UniProt Align**. how to make alignment of myoglobin and hemoglobin
  - **conservative** amino acid substitution. properties of side chain are similar
