## Readings

### Chapter 8 Introduction
- striking characteristics of enzymes: **catalytic power** and **specificity**

### 8.1<SPACE />Enzymes are powerful and highly specific catalysts
- even the hydration of carbon dioxide to carbonic acid is catalyzed (**carbonic anhydrase**)
- most proteolytic enzymes also catalyze the hydrolysis of an ester bond
  - useful experimentally
- **specificity** of enzyme is due to precise interaction of substrate with the enzyme

#### Many enzymes require cofactors for activity
- **apoenzyme + cofactor = holoenzyme**
- two kinds of cofactors
  - **metals**
  - small organic molecules called **coenzymes**
- cofactors can be tightly or loosely bound
  - tightly bound cofactors are called **prosthetic groups**

#### Enzymes can transform energy from one form into another
- photosynthesis
- using ATP in various ways
  - e.g. myosin: ATP $\to$ contracting muscles
  - e.g. pumps in cell membranes and organelles

### 8.4<SPACE />Michaelis-Menten model accounts for the kinetic properties of many enzymes

- **enzyme kinetics**. the study of the rates of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

#### Kinetics is the study of reaction rates
- For reaction $\ce{A -> P}$, reaction rate $V = -\frac{dA}{dt} = \frac{dP}{dt}$
- **pseudo-first-order reactions**. reactions that are second-order, but one of the reactants is present in excess and thus does not contribute to the reaction rate.
- sometimes, enzyme reactions can approximate **zero-order reactions**
- we plot $V_0$ on our graph: the **initial reaction velocity**
- Michaelis-Menten model
  - $\ce{E + S <=>[k_1][k_{-1}] ES <=>[k_2][k_{-2}] E + P}$
  - assume: because we are measuring at $t = 0$, there is no product
  - $\ce{E + S <=>[k_1][k_{-1}] ES ->[k_2] E + P}$

#### The steady-state assumption faciliates a description of enzyme kinetics

### Chapter 9 Introduction
- explores 4 kinds of enzymes:
  - serine proteases
  - carbonic anhydrases
  - restriction endonucleases
  - myosins

#### A few basic catalytic principles are used by many enzymes
- strategy 1: **binding energy**. the free energy released in the formatino of a large number of weak interactions between the enzyme and the substrate
- four additional strategies
  1. **covalent catalysis**.
      - active site contains a reactive group, usually a powerful nucleophile
      - e.g. chymotrypsin
  2. **general acid/base catalysis**.
      - molecule other than water plays the role of a proton donor/acceptor
      - e.g. chymotrypsin
  3. **catalysis by approximation**.
      - brings substrates close together
  4. **metal ion catalysis**.
      - formation of nucleophiles
        - zinc(II) ion in carbonic anhydrase
      - act as electrophiles, stabilizing negative charge
        - magnesium(II) ion in EcoRV
      - increase binding energy between enzyme and substrate
        - myosins

### 9.1<SPACE />Proteases facilitate a fundamentally difficult reaction
- hydrolysis is thermodynamically favorable
- slow: half life of  10 to 1000 years
  - due to partial double bond character
  - carbonyl group is **less electrophilic** because of resonance, making it less susceptible to Nu attack
    - esters are more reactive because positive charge will be on oxygen, rather than nitrogen
  
#### Chymotrypsin possesses a highly reactive serine residue
- **Ser195**
  - chymotrypsin was inactivated with **DIPF (diisopropylphosphofluoridate)**

#### Chymotrypsin action proceeds in two steps linked by a covalently bound intermediate
- Enzyme kinetics are often easily monitored by having the enzyme act on a **substrate analog** that forms a **colored product**
  - called a **chromogenic substrate**
- For chymotrypsin, use **_N_-acetyl-<L />-phenylalanine _p_-nitrophenyl**

![Chromogenic substrate for chymotrypsin.](./chromogenic.png)

- **stopped flow method**
  - allows us to compute the initial rate of reaction for one that is too fast to detect
- burst phase and steady state phase
  - burst phase because acylation is fast
  - steady state requires enzyme turnover, slow because hydrolysis is slow

![Covalent catalysis in chymotrypsin.](./covalent-catalysis.png)

#### Serine is part of a catalytic triad that also includes histidine and aspartate

![Catalytic triad of Asp102, His57, and Ser195.](./catalytic-triad.png)

- **oxyanion hole** stabilizes the **tetrahedral intermediate**
- **scissile bond**. the bond to be cleaved
- $\mathrm{S_1}$ pocket is the right shape for large, hydrophobic amino acids

![Specificity nomenclature for proteases.](./naming.png)

#### Catalytic triads are found in other hydrolytic enzymes
- **trypsin** and **elastase** are homologs of chymotrypsin.
- catalytic triad has emerged non-homologously at least three times $\to$ this catalytic strategy is an especially effective approach to the hydrolysis of peptides and related bonds

#### The catalytic triad has been dissected by site-directed mutagenesis
- $K_M$ measures binding; unchanged by mutation
- S221A $\to$ $k_{\text{cat}}$ fell to 1 millionth of its value for wild type enzyme
- N155G $\to$ reduces $k_{\text{cat}}$ to 0.2% of its value; **oxyanion hole** stabilizing is important.

#### Cysteine, aspartyl, and metalloproteases are other major classes of peptide-cleaving enzymes
- cysteine: **papain**
  - mammalian homologs: **cathepsins** (involved in immune system, cellular turnover)
  - convergent evolution: **caspases** (apoptosis)
- aspartyl: aspartic acid; **renin**, **pepsin**, **HIV protease**
  - uses _water (hydroxide)_ as nucleophile
- metalloprotease: **thermolysin**, **carboxypeptidase A**
  - metal is almost always a **zinc ion**
  - also activates a water molecule to act as nucleophile
- all
  1. generate a nucleophile to attack the peptide carbonyl group
  2. polarize the peptide carbonyl group
  3. stabilize a tetrahedral intermediate

#### Protease inhibitors are important drugs
- captopril inhibits **angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)**
- **HIV protease inhibitors**
  - two carbonyl groups of inhibitor are hydrogen bonded to water molecule, which is hydrogen bonded to peptide NH group in the flaps
  - this interaction does not occur in _cellular proteases_ (specific to HIV protease)

## Lecture notes

### Hb
- oxyHb is red because of the electron promotion in the crystal splitting
- $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_2$ touch each other at the **switch region**; the **switch** region and the **heme-binding** region is conserved.

#### Sequential (KNF) model <T tag="test" />
- based on the idea of induced fit
- allows intermediate forms between T and R
- can explain **negative cooperativity**
  - intermediate states can be worse at binding

#### Concerted (MWC) model <T tag="test" />
- all or none model
- _cannot_ explain negative cooperativity
  - binding cannot make the model any lower affinity (can only shift equilibrium, but equilibrium is already on the T state)
  - _if we started with the high affinity state, as soon as a molecule bound, it would be released_
- more data can be explained by the MWC model

#### Hill equation
- Archibald Hill
- **Hill equation**
  - $y_{\ce{Hb}} = \dfrac{p\ce{O2}^n}{K_D^n + p\ce{O2}^n}$
- Hb: $n = 2.8$
- Mb: $n = 1$
- **positive cooperativity**: $n > 1$
- **negative cooperativity**: $n < 1$
  - useful application: **metabolic pathways**: negative allostery is often negative cooperativity
- $n$ must be less than or equal to the number of subunits
- Hill plot: need to turn exponential plot into a linear plot
  1. solve for $1 - y$ (%free Hb)
      - $1 - y = \frac{K_D^n}{K_D^n + {p\ce{O2}}^n}$
  2. solve for $\frac{y}{1 - y}$
      - bound/free = $\dfrac{p\ce{O2}^n}{K_D^n}$
  3. experiment: maasure $y$ as function of $pO2$
      - plot $\log(\dfrac{y}{1 - y}) = n\log p\ce{O2} - \underbrace{n\log K_D}_{\text{constant}}$; a **log-log plot**
      - **physically measure _with a ruler_ the rise over run to get the slope in a log-log plot**
      - slope is $n$
      - $n$ of the Hill plot is the **steepest slope**  (Hb's curve bends)
      - $p_{50}$ is where $\frac{y}{1-y} = 1$ (50% bound)
        - extrapolate slopes from the _first bound_ and _last bound_ oxygens
        - $p_{50}$ is a measure of how hard it is to bind
          - $p_{50, \text{last}} = \pu{0.3 mmHg}$
          - $p_{50, \text{first}} = \pu{30 mmHg}$

#### Evolutionary conservation
- If a mutation disrupts allostery, then we get a disease

#### Bohr effect
- driven by **salt bridges**
- low pH, high CO2 concentration **stabilize the T state**
- CO2 reacts with the N-termini of the **$\beta$ chain** to form a **carbamate** with a net **negative charge**
  - the terminus has converted from a **positive to negative charge**
  - In T state, **Lys82** is stabilized next to carbamate
- low pH: **allosteric effect**
  - observation: $\ce{Hb.O2 + 2H+ <=> Hb.2H+ + 4O2}$
    - reason 1: N-terminus of **$\alpha$ chains** can be protonated
    - <T tag="see handwritten" />
- another allosteric effector Hb: **2,3-BPG**
  - hole is **smaller** in **oxy form**
  - can only fit in the **T state**
  - at high altitude, RBC make more **2,3-BPG**
    - body gets better at _releasing_ oxygen
  - **fetal Hb**
    - $\alpha_2\gamma_2$
    - better at grabbing oxygen (in order to grab it from mother's blood)
    - His143 $\to$ Ser143: binds less 2,3-BPG $\implies$ binds $\ce{O2}$ better

#### Sickle cell anemia
- allostery **gone bad**

### Enzyme chemistry
- enzymes are catalysts
- **catalyst**. a substance that accelerates a reaction but is not used up or permanently changed <T tag="test" />
- enzymes act on **substrates (S)** to form **products (P)**
- it **does not change the equilibrium**
  - only changes rate constant $k$
- **properties**
  1. catalyze a diverse range of reactions
  2. exquisite substrate specificity w.r.t. size, shape, charge
  3. high speeds and catalytic efficiency: often increase rate by $10^6$ or more
- many enzymes need helpers to catalyze reactions: **cofactors**
  - inorganic ions
  - derived from **vitamins** (**coenzymes**)
- **apoenzyme**. enzyme that uses cofactor but without cofactor bound
- **holoenzyme**. enzyme that uses cofactor with cofactor bound
- **prosthetic group**. tightly bound cofactor

#### 4 basic catalytic mechanisms
1. **covalent catalysis**
    - enzyme active site is temporarily modified
2. **general acid/base catalysis**
    - something in enzyme acts as electron donor/acceptor
3. **metal ion catalysis**
    - electron donor/acceptor _or_ activating water _or_ shielding charge
4. **catalysis by approximation**
    - place orbitals next to each other
- enzymes can use multiple mechanisms at the same time <T tag="test" />; list all mechanisms
- **enzymology**. the study of enzymes

#### Chymotrypsin
- a protease, specifically a **hydrolase**
  - only if **R<sub>1</sub> is aromatic**
- made in the **pancreas**
