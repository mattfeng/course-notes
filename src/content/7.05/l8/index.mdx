## Readings

### Chapter 8 Introduction
- striking characteristics of enzymes: **catalytic power** and **specificity**

### 8.1<SPACE />Enzymes are powerful and highly specific catalysts
- even the hydration of carbon dioxide to carbonic acid is catalyzed (**carbonic anhydrase**)
- most proteolytic enzymes also catalyze the hydrolysis of an ester bond
  - useful experimentally
- **specificity** of enzyme is due to precise interaction of substrate with the enzyme

#### Many enzymes require cofactors for activity
- **apoenzyme + cofactor = holoenzyme**
- two kinds of cofactors
  - **metals**
  - small organic molecules called **coenzymes**
- cofactors can be tightly or loosely bound
  - tightly bound cofactors are called **prosthetic groups**

#### Enzymes can transform energy from one form into another
- photosynthesis
- using ATP in various ways
  - e.g. myosin: ATP $\to$ contracting muscles
  - e.g. pumps in cell membranes and organelles

### 8.4<SPACE />Michaelis-Menten model accounts for the kinetic properties of many enzymes

TODO

### Chapter 9 Introduction
- explores 4 kinds of enzymes:
  - serine proteases
  - carbonic anhydrases
  - restriction endonucleases
  - myosins

#### A few basic catalytic principles are used by many enzymes
- strategy 1: **binding energy**. the free energy released in the formatino of a large number of weak interactions between the enzyme and the substrate
- four additional strategies
  1. **covalent catalysis**.
      - active site contains a reactive group, usually a powerful nucleophile
      - e.g. chymotrypsin
  2. **general acid/base catalysis**.
      - molecule other than water plays the role of a proton donor/acceptor
      - e.g. chymotrypsin
  3. **catalysis by approximation**.
      - brings substrates close together
  4. **metal ion catalysis**.
      - formation of nucleophiles
        - zinc(II) ion in carbonic anhydrase
      - act as electrophiles, stabilizing negative charge
        - magnesium(II) ion in EcoRV
      - increase binding energy between enzyme and substrate
        - myosins

### 9.1<SPACE />Proteases facilitate a fundamentally difficult reaction
- hydrolysis is thermodynamically favorable
- slow: half life of  10 to 1000 years
  - due to partial double bond character
  - carbonyl group is **less electrophilic** because of resonance, making it less susceptible to Nu attack
    - esters are more reactive because positive charge will be on oxygen, rather than nitrogen
  
#### Chymotrypsin possesses a highly reactive serine residue
- **Ser195**
  - chymotrypsin was inactivated with **DIPF (diisopropylphosphofluoridate)**

#### Chymotrypsin action proceeds in two steps linked by a covalently bound intermediate
- Enzyme kinetics are often easily monitored by having the enzyme act on a **substrate analog** that forms a **colored product**
  - called a **chromogenic substrate**
- For chymotrypsin, use **_N_-acetyl-<L />-phenylalanine _p_-nitrophenyl**

- **stopped flow method**
  - allows us to compute the initial rate of reaction for one that is too fast to detect
- burst phase and steady state phase
  - burst phase because acylation is fast
  - steady state requires enzyme turnover, slow because hydrolysis is slow

#### Serine is part of a catalytic triad that also includes histidine and aspartate

![Catalytic triad of Asp102, His57, and Ser195.](./catalytic-triad.png)

- **oxyanion hole** stabilizes the **tetrahedral intermediate**
- **scissile bond**. the bond to be cleaved
- $\mathrm{S_1}$ pocket is the right shape for large, hydrophobic amino acids

#### Catalytic triads are found in other hydrolytic enzymes
