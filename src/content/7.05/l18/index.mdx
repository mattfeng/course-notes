### 29.3<SPACE/>The transcription products of eukaryotic polymerases are processed

#### RNA polymerase I produces three ribosomal RNAs

#### RNA polymerase III produces transfer RNA

#### The product of RNA polymerase II, the pre-mRNA transcript, acquires a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail

#### Small regulatory RNAs are cleaved from larger precursors

#### RNA editing changes the proteins encoded by mRNA

#### Sequences at the ends of introns specify splice sites in mRNA precursors

#### Splicing consists of two sequential transesterification reactions

#### Small nuclear RNAs in spliceosomes catalyze the splicing of mRNA precursors

#### Transcription and processing of mRNA are coupled

#### Mutations that affect pre-mRNA splicing cause disease

#### Most human pre-mRNAs can be spliced in alternative ways to yield different proteins

### 29.4<SPACE/>The discovery of catalytic RNA was revealing regard to both mechanism and evolution
