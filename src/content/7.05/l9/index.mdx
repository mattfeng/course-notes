## Readings

### 8.2<SPACE />Gibbs free energy is a useful thermodynamic function for understanding enzymes

#### $\DGS$ is related to the equilibrium constant

- $\DGS$
  - reactants present at 1M concentration
  - 1 atm pressure
- $\DGSS$. **standard free energy change at pH 7**
  - activity of water is 1
  - activity of $\ce{H+}$ is 1 (corresponds to pH 7)
- $\DG = \DGS + RT \ln Q$
  - a reaction can be made spontaneous by adjusting concentrations of reactant and product

### 10.4<SPACE />Many enzymes are activated by specific proteolytic cleavage
