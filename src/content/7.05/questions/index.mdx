# Questions

## Answered
- Would you ever prepare a buffer with more than one conjugate acid/base pair?
  - No; no practical benefit.
- Why can't the MWC model explain negative cooperativity?
  - What about the KNF model allows it to explain negative cooperativity?
  - MWC model is symmetric; if we modify the equilibrium such that $K$ decreases as more ligand binds, we get the same model but with T and R states swapped.
  - The KNF model is asymmetric; we can decrease the $K$ values to model negative cooperativity.
  - If we start in the high affinity, unbound state, as soon as a ligand bound, it would be released if the equilibrium shifted to unbounded (and thus we could not bind another ligand).
- Why does $\ce{Fe2+}$ have 6 _d_ electrons? Shouldn't it have 4?
  - We remove the $\mathrm{4s^2}$ electrons first.
- Is it possible for pH to change without pCO2?
  - Yes; metabolic acidosis/alkalosis.
- pCO2 without pH?
  - No.
- Why is there a delay in the deacylation phase? Why does all enzyme have to be in ES complex for deacylation to occur?
  - All the enzyme doesn't need to be in the deacylation base, but the burst phase is simply much faster that we can assume everything is completed before the deacylation even starts.
- What is the stopped-flow method?
  - Don't start the reaction; use a hypodermic syringe to inject.
