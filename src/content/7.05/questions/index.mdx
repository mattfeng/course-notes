# Questions

- Would you ever prepare a buffer with more than one conjugate acid/base pair?
  - No; no practical benefit.
- Why can't the MWC model explain negative cooperativity?
  - What about the KNF model allows it to explain negative cooperativity?
  - MWC model is symmetric; if we modify the equilibrium such that $K$ decreases as more ligand binds, we get the same model but with T and R states swapped.
  - The KNF model is asymmetric; we can decrease the $K$ values to model negative cooperativity.
- In `PS1, Problem 1`, why would we need to adjust pH with $\ce{HCl}$/$\ce{NaOH}$?
- In `PS1, Problem 6`, why do we have to account for water vapor in our calculation of 5% CO2?
