# Lecture 1. Classes of biomolecules; pH, buffers and titration curves

## Readings

_pp. 1-4, 13-17, Appendix 1 (22-23) (11 pages)_

### pp. 1-4

#### Biochemical unity underlies biological diversity
- e.g. TATA-box-binding protein (TBP)
- <Def term="metabolite" />
- life began approximately 3.5 bya
- oxygen atmosphere formed from 2 to 1.5 bya
- key metabolic processes also are common to many organisms
- 

### pp. 13-17

#### Acid-base reactions
- $K$ vs $K_W$ (biochemistry uses $K_W = 1.0 \times 10^{-14}$)
    - biochemistry assumes that <C chem="\ce{[H2O]} = \pu{55.5 M}" />

#### Acid-base reactions can disrupt the double helix
- DNA dissociates at $\PH = 9$ (guanine deprotonated)
    - 9 comes from <PKA /> of guanine

#### Buffers regulate pH in organisms and in the laboratory
- buffer functions best at <PKA /> of acid component

## Questions

### Readings
- Fischer projections for long chains? What is the stereochemistry?
    - The Fischer projection is not physically accurate.
    - The Fischer projection is **defined** so that every arm branches out of the page.
- How do I make a buffer?
