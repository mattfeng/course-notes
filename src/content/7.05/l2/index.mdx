# Lecture 2. Amino Acids and Proteins

- Date: _02/02_
- Readings: _pp. 27-39, 57-59_

## Reading notes

### pp. 27-39

- proteins are linear chains of amino acids
- proteins contain a wide range of functional groups
- proteins interact with each other to form complex assemblies
- some proteins are rigid; others are flexible
    - conformational changes enable **regulated assembly of protein complexes** and **transmission of information within/between cells**

#### 2.1<SPACE />Proteins are built from a repertoire of 20 amino acids
- only <L /> amino acids are constituents of proteins
- **zwitterion**
    - $\ce{-NH2}$ is a base; pKa high (~9); protonated at neutral pH
    - $\ce{-COOH}$ is an acid; pKa low (~2); deprotonated at neutral pH because solution has less $\ce{H+}$, $\ce{-COOH}$ will donate

#### 2.2<SPACE />Primary structure: amino acids are linked by peptide bonds to form polypeptide chains

### pp. 57-59

#### Protein modification and cleavage confer new capabilities

- **acetyl groups** on N termini of proteins makes them **more resistant to degradation**
- **hydroxyl groups** on prolines (**hydroxyproline**) stabilizes fibers of newly synthesized collagen
    - insufficient vitamin C <RA /> insufficient hydroxylation <RA /> abnormal collagen fibers that cannot maintain normal tissue strength
- **$\gamma$-carboxyglutamate**
    - vitamin K deficiency <RA /> insuf. carboxylation of glutamate in **prothrombin** (clotting protein) <RA /> hemorrhage
- **carbohydrate** units on **Asp**, **Ser**, and **Thr**
    - usually on proteins that are
        - secreted, or
        - on surface of cells
    - makes proteins **more hydrophilic** and able to interact with other proteins
- **fatty acid** on **$\alpha$-amino group** or **cysteine sulfhydryl group**
    - make a more **hydrophobic** protein
- **phosphorylation** of _hydroxyl amino acids **Ser** and **Thr**_
    - phosphoserine, phosphothreonine are the most common modified amino acids in proteins
    - **insulin** works by phosphorylating hydroxyl group on  **tyrosine**
- GFP works because of chemical reaction of Ser-Tyr-Gly within center of protein
    - rearrangement and oxidation
- cleavage
    - fibrinogen
    - trypsinogen
    - proinsulin

### Questions
- What is the $\alpha$ amino group?
- Why do we still say that proteins spontaneously fold when in fact they require the right conditions (including chaperone proteins)?
