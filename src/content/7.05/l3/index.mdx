## Readings

### pp. 65-84 (Chapter 3)

- proteins can be separated based on
    - solubility
    - size
    - charge
    - binding ability
- **the proteome is the functional representation of the genome**
    - the **proteome is much larger than the genome**
        - almost all gene products can be modified in some way

#### 3.1<SPACE />The purification of proteins is an essential first step in understanding their function
- **the assay: how do we recognize the protein that we are looking for?**
    - an **assay** tests for some unique identifying property of the protein
    - for enzymes, **assay measures enzyme activity**
        - e.g. lactate dehydrogenase
        - NADH absorbs light at 340 nm, $\ce{NAD+}$ does not
        - NADH is product, $\ce{NAD+}$ is reactant; assay measures absorbance developed as reaction proceeds.
    - also need a way of determining **protein concentration**
    - assay + protein concentration = **specific activity**, which will rise as _purity increases_
- **proteins must be released from the cell to be purified**
    - perform **differential centrifugation**, and then assay the different fractions and closely work with the one with _highest activity_
- **proteins can be purified according to solubility, size, charge, and specific binding affinity**
    - purification techniques
        - solubility
            - **salting out**. proteins are less soluble at high salt concentrations
            - **dialysis**. used to remove small molecules in cell fractionate; not used for purification
        - size
            - **gel-filtration chromatography**. small molecules get stuck in beads and flow slower; large molecules flow faster
        - charge
            - **ion-exchange chromatography**.
                - **elute**. release
                - elute by increasing concentration of salt (salt competes in binding to charged beads) in eluting buffer
        - specific binding affinity
            - **affinity chromatography**.
                - used to isolate proteins **expressed from cloned genes**
                    - add additional amino acids such as a _His tag_
                    - _His_ binds strongly to nickel(II)
                    - elute by addition of **imidazole** that binds to metal ions and displaces the protein
        - **high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)**
            - column materials more finely divided $\implies$ greater resolving power
            - requires pressure applied to column to get usable flow rates
- How do we know purity is increasing?
    - specific activity increases
    - number of different proteins decreases $\implies$ **gel electrophoresis**
        -
