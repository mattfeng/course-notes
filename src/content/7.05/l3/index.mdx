## Readings

### pp. 65-84 (Chapter 3)

- proteins can be separated based on
    - solubility
    - size
    - charge
    - binding ability
- **the proteome is the functional representation of the genome**
    - the **proteome is much larger than the genome**
        - almost all gene products can be modified in some way

#### 3.1<SPACE />The purification of proteins is an essential first step in understanding their function
- **the assay: how do we recognize the protein that we are looking for?**
    - an **assay** tests for some unique identifying property of the protein
    - for enzymes, **assay measures enzyme activity**
        - e.g. lactate dehydrogenase
        - NADH absorbs light at 340 nm, $\ce{NAD+}$ does not
        - NADH is product, $\ce{NAD+}$ is reactant; assay measures absorbance developed as reaction proceeds.
    - also need a way of determining **protein concentration**
    - assay + protein concentration = **specific activity**, which will rise as _purity increases_
- **proteins must be released from the cell to be purified**
    - perform **differential centrifugation**, and then assay the different fractions and closely work with the one with _highest activity_
- **proteins can be purified according to solubility, size, charge, and specific binding affinity**
    - purification techniques
        - solubility
            - **salting out**. proteins are less soluble at high salt concentrations
            - **dialysis**. used to remove small molecules in cell fractionate; not used for purification
        - size
            - **gel-filtration chromatography**. small molecules get stuck in beads and flow slower; large molecules flow faster
        - charge
            - **ion-exchange chromatography**.
                - **elute**. release
                - elute by increasing concentration of salt (salt competes in binding to charged beads) in eluting buffer
        - specific binding affinity
            - **affinity chromatography**.
                - used to isolate proteins **expressed from cloned genes**
                    - add additional amino acids such as a _His tag_
                    - _His_ binds strongly to nickel(II)
                    - elute by addition of **imidazole** that binds to metal ions and displaces the protein
        - **high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)**
            - column materials more finely divided $\implies$ greater resolving power
            - requires pressure applied to column to get usable flow rates
- How do we know purity is increasing?
    - specific activity increases
    - number of different proteins decreases $\implies$ **gel electrophoresis**
        - $v = Ez/f$
            - $v$. velocity of migration
            - $E$. electric field strength
            - $z$. net charge on molecule (protein)
            - $f$. frictional coefficient
        - $f = 6\pi\eta r$
            - $r$. radius
            - $\eta$. the viscosity of the medium
        - conducted in a gel so that $\eta$ is high, leading to better separation
        - proteins migrate from **negative to positive**, usually from **top to bottom**
        - mobility of chains is linear proportional to the **logarithm of their mass**
            - some carbohydrate rich proteins don't follow this empirical relation
        - very little protein needed: less than $\pu{0.1 \mu g}$
        - proteins that differ in mass by 2% (about 10 aa) can be distinguished with SDS-PAGE
    - **isoelectric focusing**. use pH gradient, separate by **isoelectric point**
        - can resolve proteins that differ in pH by as little as 0.01 ($10^{0.01 \approx 1}$), so differences of one net charge can be separated.
        - do **NOT** use SDS
    - **two dimensional electrophoresis (TDE)**: SDS-PAGE with isoelectric focusing
        - use a **single-lane gel**
    - can now couple **TDE** with **mass spec**
- **ultracentrifugation is valuable for separating biomolecules and determining their masses**
- **protein purification can be made easier with the use of recombinant DNA technology**


#### 3.2<SPACE />Immunology provides important techniques with which to investigate proteins

- **antibodies to specific proteins can be generated**
- **proteins can be detected and quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)**
- **Western blotting permits the detection of proteins separated by gel electrophoresis**
- **fluorescent markers make the visualization of proteins in the cell possible**

#### 3.4<SPACE />Peptides can be synthesized by automated solid-phase methods
