## About enols/enolates
- **enolates** are good for **<SN2 /> reactions!**

![The two depictions (resonance structures) of enolates; the alpha-carbon is the nucleophile!](./assets/review/depiction-of-enolates.jpg)
- acidic vs. basic conditions
    - **enols**; important in acidic conditions (but not basic ones)
    - **enolates**; important in basic conditions (but not acidic ones)
- the **keto** form is favored over the **enol** form
    - except for
        - _phenols_. reason: aromaticity
        - _1,3-diketones_ (_1,3-dicarbonyls_). reason: **hydrogen bond** between -OH and carbonyl oxygen and **resonance**
            - _2,4-pentadione_ exists as 1:3 keto:enol ratio.

### Tautomerization

## To enols/enolates

### Ketones <RA /> enolates

#### Powerful bases deprotonate ald/ket to form enolates
- $\alpha$-carbon <PKA /> is around **20** (<PKB /> is **-6**).
