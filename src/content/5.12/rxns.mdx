<Collapse title="About LDA">

- $\alpha$-carbon <PKA /> is around **20** (<PKB /> is **-6**).
- The <PKB /> of amide anions is $14 - 35.7 =$ **-21.7**.
- amide anions are used to get 100% formation of enolates.
  - note the difference between [amide anion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azanide) and an [amide (carboxamides)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide).

- LDA is **highly hindered** (weak nucleophile).
  - **the less hindered proton will be removed** <RA /> the **less stable enolate** is the **kinetic product** under the following conditions:
    - solvent: <C chem="\ce{THF}" />
    - temperature: <C chem="\pu{-78 ^\circ C}" />

## From enols/enolates

### Enolate <RA /> ketones (forming <C chem="\ce{C-C}" /> bonds)

#### <Rxn /> Alkylation using alkyl halides (forms <C chem="\ce{C-C}" /> bonds)

TODO

### Enolate <RA /> $\alpha$-halo carbonyl compounds

#### <Rxn /> $\alpha$-halogenation with <C chem="\ce{Br2}" /> in acidic conditions (`smith5e, 23.7C`/`kakioka, WS_11_23`)

- **_reagents_**
  - bromide <C chem="\ce{Br2}" />
- **_solvent_**
  - often acetic acid (<C chem="\ce{AcOH}" />)

<Collapse title="Reaction details">

- _stereochemistry_
  - **racemic** (no control over adding to top or bottom of enolate)
- _regiochemistry_
  - adds to **less sterically hindered side**

#### <Rxn /> Haloform reaction (formation of <C chem="\ce{CHX3}" />) (`smith5e, 23.7B`/`kakioka, WS_11_23`)

<Collapse title="Reaction details">

- notes
  - overhalogenation occurs because the added halogen makes the $\alpha$-hydrogens even more acidic and likely to be deprotonated by the base.

  - **racemic** (no control over adding to top or bottom of enolate)

## About enols/enolates
- **enolates** are good for **<SN2 /> reactions!**
- **enols** are much more nucleophlic than regular <C chem="\ce{C=C}" /> double bonds; see the resonance structure.

![The two depictions (resonance structures) of enolates; the alpha-carbon is the nucleophile!](./assets/review/depiction-of-enolates.jpg)

- acidic vs. basic conditions
    - **enols**; important in acidic conditions (but not basic ones)
    - **enolates**; important in basic conditions (but not acidic ones)
- the **keto** form is favored over the **enol** form
    - except for
        - _phenols_. reason: aromaticity
        - _1,3-diketones_ (_1,3-dicarbonyls_). reason: **hydrogen bond** between -OH and carbonyl oxygen and **resonance**
            - _2,4-pentadione_ exists as 1:3 keto:enol ratio.

![1,3-diketone (1,3-dicarbonyl).](./assets/review/1,3-diketone.jpg)

### Tautomerization

![Acid-catalyzed tautomerization.](./assets/review/acid-catalyzed-tautomerization.jpg)

- we use _acid_ to favor **enol** over **keto** form

### Enolates should avoid water and alcohols

- once you make an enolate, **water and alcohols** have low enough <PKA /> that they will protonate your enolate, **destroying it**.

### Racemization/epimerization
- deprotonation and reprotonation at the $\alpha$-carbon (a hydrogen must be present) will **racemize a stereogenic center**
- if there are other stereogenic centers, the term **epimerization** is used
