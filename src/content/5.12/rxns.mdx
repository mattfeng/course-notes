## About enols/enolates
- **enolates** are good for **<SN2 /> reactions!**

![The two depictions (resonance structures) of enolates; the alpha-carbon is the nucleophile!](./assets/review/depiction-of-enolates.jpg)

- the **keto** form is favored over the **enol** form
    - except for _phenols_ and _1,3-diketones_
