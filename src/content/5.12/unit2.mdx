## lecture 11: nucleophiles, electrophiles, electrophilic addition to alkenes (1)

### basicity vs. nucleophilicity
- basicity: _thermodynamics_ ($\Delta G$)
- nucleophilicity: _kinetics_ ($\Delta G^\ddagger$)

## lecture 12: electrophilic addition to alkenes (2)
- difference between energy diagram and RCD
    - **energy diagram.** energy vs. conformation
    - **reaction coordinate diagram (RCD).** energy diagrams (energy vs. reaction stage) for reactions
- the **rate determining step** is the one with the higher $\Delta G^\ddagger$
- **reactive intermediate**. an intermediate that is highly reactive (_concentration never builds up in a reaction_)
    - four types
        - carbocations
        - carbanions
        - radicals
        - carbenes (<C chem="\ce{R-(C^{(2.)})-R'}" /> or <C chem="\ce{R=C^{(2.)}}" />)

### which carbocation is the most stable?
- stabilizing carbocations
    - inductive effects
    - resonance
    - hybridization
        - which orbital is missing the electron?
        - e.g. $sp^2$ missing an electron is worse than a $p$ orbital missing an electron
    - hyperconjugation
- **hyperconjugation**. adjacent $\sigma$ bonds donate electron density into an electron-deficient $p$-orbital.
    - carbocations with more <C chem="\ce{R}" /> groups are more stable, **because of hyperconjugation**

### markovnikov's rule
- in electrophilic addition of <C chem="\ce{H-X}" /> to an unsymmetrical alkene, the **added <C chem="\ce{H}" /> ends up on the less substituted carbon** (and the <C chem="\ce{X}" /> ends up on the more substituted carbon)
    - this is because the carbocation intermediate with **more <C chem="\ce{R}" /> groups** will be more stable
    - this justification works because of **hammond's postulate**
        - the **intermediate/product** is more stable, so the **transition state** will also be more stable

### hammond postulate: blending kinetics and thermodynamics
- hydrohalogenation occurs under **kinetic control**

## lecture 13: electrophilic addition to alkenes (3)

## lecture 14: intro to organic synthesis, oxidation and reduction
## lecture 15: oxidation of alkenes and intro to radical chemistry
## lecture 16: radical reactions and alkyne chemistry
## lecture 17: the chemistry of alkynes
## lecture 18: alkynes and organic synthesis

## general concepts

### basicity vs. nucleophilicity
- basicity: _thermodynamics_ ($\Delta G$)
- nucleophilicity: _kinetics_ ($\Delta G^\ddagger$)

### kinetic vs. thermodynamic control, hammonds postulate
- **kinetic control.** the major product is the product that forms _fastest_ (i.e. lower $\Delta G^\ddagger$)
    - associated with **irreversible reactions**
- reversible reaction (i.e. equilibrium): **thermodynamic control**
- the **Hammond postulate** allows us to link thermodynamic stability with transition state stability, allowing us to use **thermodynamic stability to predict kinetics**

### markovnikov
- non-hydrogen substituent ends up on the _more substituted carbon_ (think: **m**arkovnikov is **m**ore substituted)

## problem solving

### which compound is the most nucleophilic?
- most negative charge aggregated in one location
- more electronegative $\implies$ worse nucleophile
    - electronegative atoms like holding onto their negative charge
- polarizability
- steric effects
- references
    - [ucalgary](https://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/Carey5th/Ch08/ch8-5.html)
    - [socratic](https://socratic.org/questions/what-determines-the-nucleophile-s-strength)
- **the more stable, the less basic**
- inductive effects that put electron density on carbon
- lone pairs
- $\pi$ bonds

### which compound is the most electrophilic?
- most positive charge aggregated in one location
    - full positive charge stronger than partial
- positive charge on more electronegative atom $\implies$ better electrophile
- more electronegative is better electrophile
- least sterically hindered
- [the oxygen in a C=O double bond is more electronegative than that in a C-O bond](https://archive.md/SKsEn)
    - resonance structure <C chem="\ce{C^+-O-}" /> implies greater charge separation
- inductive effects
- empty _p_-orbital

### which radical is the most stable?
- compare BDEs; higher BDE = less stable = more reactive
- _reactions will preferentially form the more stable radical_
- stabilizing effects
    - resonance delocalizaiton
    - atomic effects
        - more electronegative = less stable, because radicals are electron-deficient
    - hyperconjugation (most stable 3º > 2º > 1º least stable)
    - hybridization (most stable p > sp3 > sp2 > sp)
        - more _s_ character has more penalty for electron-deficiency

## numbers
- <C chem="\pu{1.36 kcal/mol}" /> is 10-fold rate difference
- radical stability
    - 1º < 2º < 3º, each <C chem="\Delta \Delta G^{\circ} \approx 2 \text{-} 3 \pu{kcal/mol}" />
- carbocation stability
    - 1º < 2º < 3º, each <C chem="\Delta \Delta G^{\circ} \approx 18 \pu{kcal/mol}" />


## reaction mechanisms

### `alkene/1`. hydrohalogenation: addition of <C chem="\ce{H-X}" /> (<C chem="\ce{X} = \ce{Cl, Br, I}" />)
- reagents
    - hydrohalogen: <C chem="\ce{H-X}" />

![Hydrohalogenation reaction mechanism.](../../images/5.12/unit2/hydrohalogenation.png)

#### stereochemistry and regiochemistry
- regiochemistry: markovnikov addition
- stereochemistry: racemic mixture

#### additional notes
- **kinetic controlled**: **once carbocation forms, there is no chance the reaction goes backwards**, i.e. _no equilibrium_
- if _another nucleophile is also present_ (e.g. <C chem="\ce{H2O}" />), it will also react

### `alkene/2`. acid-catalyzed hydration
- reagents

#### regiochemistry and stereochemistry
- follows _Markovnikov_ addition
- stereochemistry: forms _racemic_ mixtures

#### additional notes
- if the solvent is an alcohol rather than water (i.e. <C chem="\ce{R-OH}" />), then in the second step, an alcohol will function as the nucleophile instead of water, leading to attachment of a <C chem="\ce{-OR}" /> group.

### `alkene/3`. halogenation: _anti_ addition of <C chem="\ce{X2}" />
- reagents
    - 1 equivalent <C chem="\ce{X2}" />
    - solvent: <C chem="\ce{CCl4}" /> or <C chem="\ce{CH2Cl2}" />

#### stereochemistry and regiochemistry
- regiochemistry: irrelevant
- stereochemistry: _anti_ addition

### `alkene/4`. halohydrin formation
- reagents
    - halogen: <C chem="\ce{X2}" />
    - solvent: <C chem="\ce{H2O}" />
- bridged halonium intermediate

#### stereochemistry and regiochemistry
- stereochemistry: _anti_ addition
- regiochemistry: electrophile <C chem="\ce{X+}" /> bonds to the less substituted atom; <C chem="\ce{OH}" /> bonds to the more substituted carbon
    - transition state, positive charge passes through carbon (partial carbocationic character; more substituted is more stable; water attacks the more substituted carbon)

### `alkene/5`. hydroboration-oxidation: anti-markovnikovian _syn_-addition of water

#### stereochemistry
- only _syn_ addition is observed

### `alkene/6`. catalytic hydrogenation: addition of <C chem="\ce{H2}" />

- we need an acid catalyst because _water is not acidic enough to protonate an alkene on its own_

### `alkene/7`. epoxidation

- reagents
    - peroxyacid, e.g.
        - **<i>m</i>CPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).**
        - **peroxybenzoic acid** (<C chem="\ce{PhCO3H}" />).

![peroxybenzoic acid.](./assets/unit2/peroxybenzoic-acid.png)

### `alkene/8`. _anti_ dihydroxylation

- an extension of epoxidation
- reagents
    - a nucleophile, <C chem="\ce{NaOH}" />

#### stereochemistry and regiochemistry
- stereochemistry is _anti_ addition

### `alkene/9`. _syn_ dihydroxylation

        - _N_-methyl morpholine-_N_-oxide (<C chem="\ce{NMO}" />)
        - solvent: aqueous acetone
    - stoichiometric

#### regiochemistry and stereochemistry
- regiochemistry is **irrevelant** since we are adding two of the same group
- stereochemistry is _syn_ addition
    - **steric hindrance** can prevent particular stereoisomers from forming

### `alkene/10`. ozonolysis: addition of <C chem="\ce{O3}" /> followed by cleavage; forms _ketones_ and _aldehydes_

- reagents
    - step 1

            - dimethylsulfide: <C chem="\ce{Me2S}" />

### stereochemistry and regiochemistry
- _stereochemistry and regiochemistry are irrelevant_

### `alkene/11`. oxymecuration-demercuration

### `alkyne/2`. alkyne halogenation: addition of <C chem="\ce{X-X}" /> (<C chem="\ce{X = Cl, Br}" />) (lec 16)

- reagents
    - 1 equivalent <C chem="\ce{X2}" /> for _trans_ halide
    - 2 equivalents (or excess) <C chem="\ce{X2}" /> for tetrahalide
    - solvent (not needed in Smith): <C chem="\ce{CCl4}" /> or <C chem="\ce{CH2Cl2}" />

#### stereochemistry
- _trans_ product only

### `alkyne/3`. alkyne acid-catalyzed hydration: addition of <C chem="\ce{H-OH}" />, followed by tautomerization to _ketones_

- for terminal alkynes, a mixture of catalysts (<C chem="\ce{H2SO4, HgSO4}" />) is needed in order to activate the alkyne
- reagents
    - water, sulfuric acid: <C chem="\ce{H2O}" />, <C chem="\ce{H2SO4}" />
    - mercuric sulfate: <C chem="\ce{HgSO4}" />

#### regiochemistry and stereochemistry
