## lecture 11: nucleophiles, electrophiles, electrophilic addition to alkenes (1)

### basicity vs. nucleophilicity
- basicity: _thermodynamics_ ($\Delta G$)
- nucleophilicity: _kinetics_ ($\Delta G^\ddagger$)

## lecture 12: electrophilic addition to alkenes (2)
- difference between energy diagram and RCD
    - **energy diagram.** energy vs. conformation
    - **reaction coordinate diagram (RCD).** energy diagrams (energy vs. reaction stage) for reactions
- the **rate determining step** is the one with the higher $\Delta G^\ddagger$
- **reactive intermediate**. an intermediate that is highly reactive (_concentration never builds up in a reaction_)
    - four types
        - carbocations
        - carbanions
        - radicals
        - carbenes (<C chem="\ce{R-(C^{(2.)})-R'}" /> or <C chem="\ce{R=C^{(2.)}}" />)

### which carbocation is the most stable?
- stabilizing carbocations
    - inductive effects
    - resonance
    - hybridization
        - which orbital is missing the electron?
        - e.g. $sp^2$ missing an electron is worse than a $p$ orbital missing an electron
    - hyperconjugation
- **hyperconjugation**. adjacent $\sigma$ bonds donate electron density into an electron-deficient $p$-orbital.
    - carbocations with more <C chem="\ce{R}" /> groups are more stable, **because of hyperconjugation**

### markovnikov's rule
- in electrophilic addition of <C chem="\ce{H-X}" /> to an unsymmetrical alkene, the **added <C chem="\ce{H}" /> ends up on the less substituted carbon** (and the <C chem="\ce{X}" /> ends up on the more substituted carbon)
    - this is because the carbocation intermediate with **more <C chem="\ce{R}" /> groups** will be more stable
    - this justification works because of **hammond's postulate**
        - the **intermediate/product** is more stable, so the **transition state** will also be more stable

### hammond postulate: blending kinetics and thermodynamics
- hydrohalogenation occurs under **kinetic control**

## lecture 13: electrophilic addition to alkenes (3)

## lecture 14: intro to organic synthesis, oxidation and reduction
## lecture 15: oxidation of alkenes and intro to radical chemistry
## lecture 16: radical reactions and alkyne chemistry
## lecture 17: the chemistry of alkynes
## lecture 18: alkynes and organic synthesis

## general concepts

### basicity vs. nucleophilicity
- basicity: _thermodynamics_ ($\Delta G$)
- nucleophilicity: _kinetics_ ($\Delta G^\ddagger$)

### kinetic vs. thermodynamic control, hammonds postulate
- **kinetic control.** the major product is the product that forms _fastest_ (i.e. lower $\Delta G^\ddagger$)
    - associated with **irreversible reactions**
- reversible reaction (i.e. equilibrium): **thermodynamic control**
- the **Hammond postulate** allows us to link thermodynamic stability with transition state stability, allowing us to use **thermodynamic stability to predict kinetics**

### markovnikov
- non-hydrogen substituent ends up on the _more substituted carbon_ (think: **m**arkovnikov is **m**ore substituted)

## problem solving

### which compound is the most nucleophilic?
- charge
- polarizability
- most negative charge aggregated in one location

### which compound is the most electrophilic?
- most positive charge aggregated in one location
    - full positive charge stronger than partial
- least sterically hindered
- [C=O double bond is more electronegative than C-O bond](https://archive.md/SKsEn)
    - resonance structure <C chem="\ce{C^+-O-}" /> implies greater charge separation

## reaction mechanisms

### `alkene/1`. hydrohalogenation: addition of <C chem="\ce{H-X}" />
- **kinetic controlled**: **once carbocation forms, there is no chance the reaction goes backwards**, i.e. _no equilibrium_

![Hydrohalogenation reaction mechanism.](../../images/5.12/unit2/hydrohalogenation.png)

### `alkene/2`. acid-catalyzed hydration


### `alkene/3`. halogenation: _anti_ addition of <C chem="\ce{X2}" />

### `alkene/4`. halohydrin formation

### `alkene/5`. hydroboration-oxidation: anti-markovnikovian synthesis of alcohols

### `alkene/6`. catalytic hydrogenation: addition of <C chem="\ce{H2}" />

- we need an acid catalyst because _water is not acidic enough to protonate an alkene on its own_

### `alkene/7`. epoxidation

- reagents
    - peroxyacid, e.g.
        - **<i>m</i>CPBA (meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid).**
        - **peroxybenzoic acid** (<C chem="\ce{PhCO3H}" />).

![peroxybenzoic acid.](./assets/unit2/peroxybenzoic-acid.png)

### `alkene/8`. _anti_ dihydroxylation

- an extension of epoxidation

### `alkene/9`. _syn_ dihydroxylation

### `alkene/10`. ozonolysis: addition of <C chem="\ce{O3}" /> followed by cleavage; forms _ketones_ and _aldehydes_

- _stereochemistry and regiochemistry are irrelevant_

### `alkene/11`. oxymecuration-demercuration

### `radical/1`. alkene hydrohalogenation: addition of <C chem="\ce{H-X}" /> via a _radical chain mechanism_

### `radical/2`. radical polymerization

### `alkyne/1`. alkyne hydrohalogenation (<C chem="\ce{X = Cl, Br, I}" />)

### `alkyne/2`. alkyne halogenation: addition of <C chem="\ce{X-X}" /> (<C chem="\ce{X = Cl, Br}" />)

### `alkyne/3`. alkyne acid-catalyzed hydration: addition of <C chem="\ce{H-OH}" />, followed by tautomerization to _ketones_

- for terminal alkynes, a mixture of catalysts (<C chem="\ce{H2SO4, HgSO4}" />) is needed in order to activate the alkyne

#### regiochemistry and stereochemistry
- this reaction is **not regioselective**; the products are mixed
- **stereochemistry is not a consideration** because the double bond becomes a single bond after tautomerization
    - there is a slight preference because one of the enols is more stable, but the effect is minimal

### `alkyne/4`. alkyne hydroboration-oxidation: anti-mknv addition of <C chem="\ce{H-OH}" />, followed by tautomerization to _aldehydes_

### `alkyne/5`. reduction of alkyne to alkane
- reagents
    - hydrogen gas: <C chem="\ce{H2}" />
    - [palladium on carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium_on_carbon): <C chem="\ce{Pd/C}" /> 
- double _syn_ addition of <C chem="\ce{H2}" />

### `alkyne/6`. reduction of alkyne to _cis_ alkene

- uses the **Lindlar reagent**

### `alkyne/7`. reduction of alkyne to _trans_ alkene (the _&ldquo;dissolving metal reduction&rdquo;_)

- involves **single electron transfer (SET)**

### `alkyne/8`. acetylide ion formation and <C chem="\ce{C-C}" /> bond formation
