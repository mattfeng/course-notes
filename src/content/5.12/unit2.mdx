- **energy diagram.** energy vs. conformation
- **reaction coordinate diagram (RCD).** energy diagrams (energy vs. reaction stage) for reactions
- the **rate determining step** is the one with the higher $\Delta G^\ddagger$
- **reactive intermediate**. an intermediate that is highly reactive (_concentration never builds up in a reaction_)
    - four types
        - carbocations
        - carbanions
        - radicals
        - carbenes (<C chem="\ce{R-(C^{(2.)})-R'}" /> or <C chem="\ce{R=C^{(2.)}}" />)
- stabilizing carbocations
    - inductive effects
    - resonance
    - hybridization
    - hyperconjugation
- **hyperconjugation**. adjacent $\sigma$ bonds donate electron density into an electron-deficient $p$-orbital.
    - carbocations with more <C chem="\ce{R}" /> groups are more stable, **because of hyperconjugation**
- empty $sp^2$ orbital is extremely unstable

### markovnikov's rule: thermodynamic control
- when electrophilic addition to an alkene happens, the added <C chem="\ce{H}" /> ends up on the less substituted carbon
    - this is because the carbocation intermediate with **more <C chem="\ce{R}" /> groups** will be more stable

### hammond postulate: blending kinetics and thermodynamics
- hydrohalogenation occurs under **kinetic control**
