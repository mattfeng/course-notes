## lecture 24: nucleophilic addition to carbonyls
## lecture 25: carbonyl condensation
## lecture 26: irreversible additions

### hydration (addition of H2O)
- two methods
    1. acid-catalyzed
        - mechansism
            1. proton transfer (making carbonyl more electrophilic)
            2. nucleophilic attack by water
    2. base-catalyzed
        - mechanism
            1. nucleophilic attack by hydroxide
            2. proton transfer

### acetal and ketal formation
- instead of hydration, use ROH
- driven by Dean-Stark trap to remove water

1. acyclic acetal
    - _p_-TsOH as [catalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Toluenesulfonic_acid)
2. cyclic acetal
    - entropically favored over acyclic acetal formation (count the number of species on both sides)
    - mechanism, via hemiketal/hemiacetal
        1. proton transfer to make carbonyl carbon more electrophilic
        2. nucleophilic attack of carbonyl carbon by alcohol
        3. proton transfer to make OH a better leaving group
            1. loss of proton from R2OH first
            2. addition of proton onto OH
        4. LLG (H2O) via elimination (_not SN2_)
        5. nucleophilic attack of carbonyl carbon by alcohol
        6. proton transfer to water

- acetals and ketals as _protecting groups_

### primary amine additions (_imines_)
- mechanism
    1. NA by amine
    2. PT
    3. PT protonating LG
    4. LLG (H2O) to form iminium ion via elimination
    5. PT to form neutral imine
- overall result: carbonyl oxygen is replaced by amine

### secondary amine additions (_enamines_)
- mechanism
    1. NA by amine
    2. PT
    3. PT protonating LG
    4. LLG to form iminium
    5. PT to base
        - no proton at N to do PT!
        - base removes hydrogen on alpha carbon, causing elimination

### amines vs. carbonyls
- reaction fastest at pH 4.5
- amines are much more basic than carbonyls
    - too acidic, and they are protonated; no reaction
- alpha protons of carbonyls are much more acidic than amines
    - too basic, and amines won't attack?
- imines are crucial for vision
    - retinol -> cis-retinal -> attaches to opsin to form rhodopsin -> cis/trans isomerization via light

## lecture 30: enols and enolates reactivity

## alcohols
- alcohols are more acidic than alkanes and amines, but less than hydrogen halides ($\text{p}K_a$ between 15 and 18)
    - reason: more stable conjugate base = higher acidity
    - reason: oxygen can stabilize alkoxide anion more than nitrogen or carbon, but less than halogen

|compound|pKa|
|:-------|:----:|
|alkanes|45 to 50|
|amines|35 to 40|
|alcohols|15 to 18|
|hydrogen halide|-10 to 3|

- **deprotonating alcohols.** two main ways
    1. use a strong base like **sodium hydride**
    2. react the alcohol with Li, Na, or K
    
### preparing alcohols

### reducing agents
1. hydrogen gas with Pt, Pd, or Ni catalyst
2. sodium borohydride (<C chem="\ce{->[NaBH4][EtOH, MeOH, or H2O]}" />)
