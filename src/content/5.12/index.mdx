    - key takeaways
        - acid/base reactions are reversible, and we are measuring **thermodynamic stability** with <PKA /> values
        - nucleophile/electrophile reactions are irreversible, and thus we can't measure stability; we can only measure reaction rates
            - a nucleophile is stronger if it has a higher rate constant $k$

## conventions used 
- in writing chemical equations
    - **substrates** (starting products) react with **reagents**
