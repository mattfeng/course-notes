# how to give a strong pitch (Parker McKee, PillarVC)

## crafting a story
- _know your audience_
- seed stage investors back **people first**: spend time on your story
    - positioning your experience
        - &ldquo;blow through walls&rdquo; mentality
        - are you self-aware? (do you want to learn?)
        - can you create momentum?
    - _first 5 minutes are critical_
- your goal in 12 to 15 slides: answer
    - who will buy it and why?
        - market
    - do we make money (over the long term)?
        - business model
    - how much can we sell?
        - market size
    - can we defend the profits?
        - moat
    - do we have the skills and experience to be successful?
        - team
- suggested slide order (tech, _bio_)
    1. cover
    2. vision
