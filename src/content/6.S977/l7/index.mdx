## JAEGAR &mdash; Hunting for Antimalarials with Generative Chemistry
- molecules are embedded in 28-dimensional latent space
- how JAEGAR generates new molecules
  1. seed molecule as starting point
  2. deterministic sampling of neighbors along principal axes proportional to eigenvalue (SVD)
  3. filter using QSAR model
- for testing antimalarials
  - train activity model with Novartis internal _Plasmodium falciparum_ proliferation assay
    - 21065 molecules
  - JAEGAR generates molecules and predicts their activity
  - use 3 proprietary molecules as seed molecules
  - consensus check JAEGAR's activities with different pQSAR model
- **EC50**. dose effective in producing 50% of maximal response

### Results
- dissimilar molecules
- high activity against _P. vivax_ PI(4)K kinase
  - **PI4K**. **phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase**
- low off-target effects (toxicity) compared to existing pan-kinase inhibitor (**staurosporine**)
- JAEGAR overestimated antimalarial activity

## Automating drug discovery (for medicinal chemists)
