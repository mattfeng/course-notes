## Computationally Optimized SARS-CoV-2 MHC Class I and II Vaccine Formulations Predicted to Target Human Haplotype Distributions (Liu, 2020)
- **human leukocyte antigen (HLA)**. the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
- paper presents methods that optimize the **presentation likelihood** of a **diverse set of vaccine peptides** to maximize vaccine immunogenicity
- immunogenicity is dependent on
    - the sequence of the peptide displayed;
    - the protein sequences of an individual's MHC genes;
        - CD8+/CD4+ T cells observe the MHC Class I/II
    - the affinity between the two
- **MHC gene alleles** have **preferences** for which peptide sequences they like to display
- classic HLA class I loci
    - HLA-A
    - HLA-B
    - HLA-C
- classic HLA class II loci
    - HLA-DR
    - HLA-DQ
    - HLA-DP
- **linkage disequilibrium (LD).** the nonrandom association of alleles of different loci
- HLA loci have LD
- MHC class I presented peptides are predominately 8 to 10 residues in length <T tag="anki" />

**Framework for vaccine design**

1. start with an initial proteome, filter out peptides with undesired properties
    - filtering step eliminates peptides that are
        - expected to be glycosylated,
        - expected to drift in sequence, and thus cause vaccine escape
        - cleaved
        - identical to peptides in the human proteome
2. score which peptides will be presented, and thus are potentially immunogenic
3. select an optimized set of candidate peptides, given the frequency of HLA haplotypes or HLA alleles in a target population

## Preliminary Immunogenicity of a Pan-COVID-19 T Cell Vaccine in HLA-A*02:01 Mice (Carter, 2021)

- T cell based adaptive immunity can be based on **short peptide sequences selected from the viral proteome that are _less subject to drift_**, and can utilize **multiple such epitopes** to provide redundancy in the event of drift.
- **MIRA**. Multiplex Identification of T-cell Receptor Antigen Specificity (MIRA)
- demonstrated that vaccine causes immunogenicity, though not possible to compare strength of response

## Questions
### Liu, 2020
- We examined 4,690 geographically sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to exclude peptides with undesired mutation rates
    - Undesired mutation rates?
- What is observed mutation probability?
