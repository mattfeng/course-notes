# Lecture 6. 

## Rethinking drug design in the AI era
- main limitation of predictive models: sensitive to **quality of underlying data**
- models need to provide answers flexibly, as drug discovery knowledge develops

## Allosteric inhibition of SHP2 phosphatase inhibits cancers driven by RTKs
- **short hairpin RNA (shRNA)** screen on 7500 genes on 300 cell types in CCLE
- SHP2 increases half-life of RasGTP
- RTK cancers sensitive to SHP2 depletion (*)
- KRAS, NRAS, BRAF sensitive cancers insensitive to SHP2 depletion (**)
- (*) and (**) verified using doxycycline-induced shRNA screen on cancer cell lines with known EGFR/ERBB2/FGFR2/EML4-ALK amplification
- SHP2 involved in pathways
  - RAS-ERK/MAPK
  - PD-1
  - BTLA
- therapeutics targeting protein tyrosine phosphatases are difficult to design because catalytic site is **solvated** and **polar**
  - thus, look for allosteric inhibitors instead

## Small-molecule WNK inhibition regulates cardiovascular and renal function
- WNK (with no lysine) kinases play critical roles in blood pressure regulation and body fluid/electrolyte homeostasis
- catalytic lysine: Lys233
- WNK463 inhibits WNk kinase and has a dose-dependent lowering of blood pressure
