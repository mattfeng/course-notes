# Week 9. Microfluidics and Frugal Science

## Microfluids ("Lab on a Chip")
- David Kong, MIT Media Lab

### Background, motivations
- 100 Âµm is possible to inkjet print (width of human hair)
  - inkjet print forms mask
  - this is why it is very common
- pL are about the smallest volumes used in microfludics

### Applications
- General idea: Microfluidics is really useful for **information**
- Foundations
  - Three valves in series: can form a **pump**
- Applications
  - Parallel gene synthesis in a microfluidic device (10 years ago)
  - Microfluidic genetic circuit assembly (5 years ago)

#### Cancer therapeutics
- miRNA boolean logic

#### Bio-remediation
- Organophosphates (VX)
  - OPH
- high-throughput protein engineering
- For TxTl can couple fluorescence with transcription and translation

#### x on a chip
- What are the features of the physical system we are trying to recapitulate?
  - e.g. replacing animal testing with organ-on-a-chip devices
- Can we take personal cells and build "me"-on-a-chip? $\to$ precision medicine
  - e.g. HIV: figure out how the different set of **proteases** involved

### Manufacturing methods for PDMS
- Why PDMS?
  - soft: can make valves
  - translucent: can image through it
  - permeable to gas: keep cells alive
- Soft lithography (2D) (George Whitesides, Steve Quake)

### 3D microfluidics
- Foundations
  - 3D printed multimaterial microfluidic value

#### Engineering the human microbiota
- 3D printed artificial guts

#### DNA assembly in 3D printed fluidics
- 3D micromixer

### Digital microfluidics (electrowetting)

### Centrifugal microfluidics

### Ampli: Paperfluidics

## Frugal Science
- Manu Prakash, Prakash Lab: Stanford University
- In solving problems, **context** matters
  - solve a problem for a small community; the solution will expand from there

### Foldscope
- Who determines what is called "science"?
- Who determines the role of science in society?

### Why do we care about frugal science?
- Certain endemic diseases are actually pandemics, just not televised.

#### Healthcare
- Roughly 1B people live without access to roads, electricity, or traditional health care

#### Education
- Half the talent in the world is not getting access to education

#### Biodiversity loss
- COP meetings are simplying moving the goalpost
- the power to care for the planet should be in the hands of the public

### Grand challenge
- Planetary scale (affordable) measurement tools for living systems
- An inclusive environment of true collaorations between amateur and professional scientists
  - e.g. farmers know more about agricultural science than many plant biologists ever will
