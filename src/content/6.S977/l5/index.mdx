# Lecture 5. Data-driven small molecule design and synthesis

- **surrogate model**. QSAR/QSPR model

## Machine learning in Computer-Aided Synthesis Planning (CASP)
- CASP generally consists of five major components
  1. template library containing disconnection rules 
  2. recursive template application engine that generates candidate reactants for target products
  3. a database containing compounds that do not need to be expanded retrosynthetically
  4. a strategy to guide the retrosynthetic search toward chemicals in that database
  5. a method for single-step or pathway-level scoring (e.g. fewer synthetic steps)

### Route planning
- contemporary strategies
  1. template library-based
  2. template-free
  3. focused template application

#### 1<SPACE/>Template library-based
- simple heuristics to balance specificity and speed
  - include atoms adjacent to reaction center if they
    1. are terminal
    2. are required for unambiguous specification of chirality
    3. belong to substructures known to influence reactivity (e.g. adjacency to a carbonyl)
- `SCScore` is a metric for measuring complexity of _synthesis_, not _structure_

#### 2<SPACE/>Template free
- downsides of templates/benefits of template free
  - calculating subgraph isomorphism is expensive
  - recommendation quality depends on template quality
  - cannot propose novel disconnections
- often convert molecules to SMILES strings

#### 3<SPACE/>Focused template application
- MCTS with NN value network
- use a nearest neighbor model to find similar reaction templates; greatly outperforms seq2seq model

### Prediction of reaction outcomes
- use of Weisfeller-Lehman network (WLN) to get molecular representation

## Accelerating high-throughput virtual screening (VS) through molecular pool-based active learning (2021)
- **QED**. quantitative estimate of drug-likeness
- MPNN can identify 94% fo the top-50000 ligands in a 100M library after testing only 2.4% (2.4M) candidate ligands
- CADD techniques fall into two categories
  - ligand-based (based on experimental data)
  - structure-based (computational docking and molecular dynamics)

### Introduction
- VS libraries are too large to exhaustively evaluate against a target, need to sample for best
- goal: find the top-$k$ hits (best docking energies)
- goal: examine the effects of surrogate model architecutre

### Results

### Conclusions

### Methods

## Amortized tree generation for bottom-up synthesis planning and synthesizable molecular design (2021)
- validate our method by
  - recovering molecules using conditional generation
  - identifying synthesizable structural analogs
  - optimizing molecular structures given oracle functions relevant to drug discovery
- TDC: therapeutic data commons
- simultaneously address the problems of _design_ and _synthesis_
- main contributions of paper
  - formulate the tasks of multi-step synthesis planning and synthesizable molecular design as a single shared task of conditional synthetic tree generation.
  - formulate a Markov decision process to model the generation of synthetic trees, allowing the generation of multi-step and convergent synthetic pathways.
  - propose a model that is capable of (1) rapid bottom-up synthesis planning and (2) constrained molecular optimization that can explore a chemical space defined by a discrete action space of reaction templates and purchasable starting materials.
  - demonstrate encouraging results on the recovery of molecules via conditional generation and on de novo molecular optimization with multiple objective functions relevant to bioactive molecule design and drug discovery.

### Related work
- synthesizable molecular design
  - no previous work had high reconstruction accuracy
- synthesis planning
  - all retrosynthetic

### Method

#### Problem definition
$$\gdef\Mp{M_{\text{product}}}$$
$$\gdef\Mt{M_{\text{target}}}$$

- reaction templates $R$
  - list of reaction templates (rather than data-driven reaction predictor) makes expanding/contracting the model easy without need to change architecture
- purchasable compounds $C$
- goal: generate valid synthetic tree $T$ with root node $\Mp$ equaling $\Mt$

#### Synthetic tree generation as a MDP
#### Conditional generation for synthesis planning
#### Genetic algorithm for molecular optimization
- procedurally simplier than RL to solve MDPs

### Experiments

#### Experiment setup
- templates from [40](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0067-7) and [41](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22077721/)
- starting reagents: **Enamine Building Blocks**
- Morgan fingerprints (length=4096, radius=2)
- optimization oracles:
  - QED
  - LogP
  - JNK3, GSK3$\beta$, DRD2 surrogate models
- docking: AutoDock Vina

#### Synthesis planning results
- recovered 51% of synthesizable targets
- recovered 4.5% of random sample of ChEMBL (assumed to not be reachable)

#### Synthesizable analog recommendation results
- many recommendations, even if failed, are experimentally useful since they are close or related to the target

#### Synthesizable molecular optimization results
- binding score predicted by Vina is better than known inhibitor
- the recommendations are actionable; the proposed molecules are simple
