# Lecture 8. Synthetic Biology Approaches to Disease Therapeutics	
- Ron Weiss, Professor

## Notes
- tackling the complexity of disease and development requires appropriately sophisticated tools for control
- central dogma of synbio
  - sensing
  - logic processing
  - actuation (e.g. therapeutic functions)
    - altered gene expression
    - changes in protein activity
    - metabolic activity
- example applications
  - cancer
    - high level: detecting and killing HeLa cancer cells
    - and going beyond Boolean logic
  - programmable organoids
    - high level: self-timed, multi-step hiPS to beta-cell differention
    - start with iPSCs and convert them to organoids
      - in particular, liver organoids
  - ultrasensitive sense-and-response
    - high level: sense abnormal blood biomarker and respond quickly
- basic building blocks
  - `R`. repressor
  - `I`. inducer
  - `O`. output
  - `NOT(R)`
  - `NOT(R) OR I`. allows for **modulation**
  - `AND(A, B)`. A, B both repress R that represses O.
- Agenda
  - Programmable organoids
  - ML to optimize cell classifiers for cancer immunotherapy
  - Neuromorphic computing in cells

### Organoids
- going from cells to mini-organs
  - regenerative medicine
  - better in-vitro testing
    - personalized in-vitro testing
- current progress
  1. primary cells
  2. co-culture of two cell types, inclusion of hydrogels and encapsulation
  3. iPSC-derived spheroids coaxed with small molecules and culture additives
  4. 3D printers, micropatterning, scaffolds
- challenges
  - how do we get all the cell-types
  - support co-development
  - proper maturation
  - pervasive vascularization
- how do we recapitulate the major aspects of organs?
- at the moment, synbio is the only tool to control the development of cells
- prior work
  - [A synthetic multicellular system for programmed pattern formation](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03461)
- `if endoderm`: doesn't work well with boolean logic
  - will transition to neuromorphic computing

```python
if dox:             # took 10 years
  # form_endoderm
  express(GATA6)
if endoderm:
  form_pancreas()
if pancreas:
  form_beta_cells()
```

- Got **liver organoids** by accident
- 3D liver organoid assays
  - D30: pervasive vasculature
  - D74: organoids
  - liver function
    - Albumin (good)
    - Urea (good)
  - ADME gene
    - some are expressed lower than desired
      - Cyp3A4 ($\in$ cytochrome P450 enzyme superfamily)

```python
# new program (Deepak Mishra)
if dox:
  express(Gata6)
if hepatocyte:
  # don't want to differentiation other cell types
  express(hepatocyte maturation TFs)
```

- problem with mammalian synthetic biology: **epigenetic silencing**. genes could not turn back on
  - potential solution: synbio at the **translational** regulation
    - genes always stay on

### ML to optimize cancer detection
- use ML to determine best stoichiometry of miRNA to detect HeLa cells

### Neuromorphic computing: Using ML to develop ML in cells
- researchers
  - Andrew Moorman
- endoderm $\to$ pancreatic progenitors need `Pdx1` expressed as a pulse
- biomarker patterns that help detect cell state are often non-binary and difficult to recognize during differentiation
- "region algebra": neuromorphic circuits for classification

#### How are neuromorphic circuits implemented?
- weighted addition
  - two inputs express the same protein
- weighted subtraction
  - use CRISPR endonuclease that stays bound
  - can't get negative values
- can change the decision boundary by changing genetic elements
- **biocompiler**
