# Lecture 3. COVID-19: Developing a Vaccine During a Pandemic

## Vaccines elicit highly conserved cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (Liu, 2022)
- Ad26.COV2.S or BNT162b2 vaccines demonstrated durable Spike-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses
  - showed extensive cross-reactivity against both the Delta and Omicron variants, including in central and effector memory cellular subpopulations
- i.e. lower levels of antibodies (B cell response), but still high level of cellular immune response (CD8+, CD4+ response)
- **cross-reactivity**. the ability of an observed agent to initiate reactions outside the main reaction expected. This is relevant to allergic reactions (undesired cross-reactivity) and broad immune response (desired cross-reactivity).
